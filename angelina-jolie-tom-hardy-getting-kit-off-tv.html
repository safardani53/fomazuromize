She also had two prop guys holding her so she wouldn’t fall off.</p><p>Playing the daughter of a brothel keeper in TV drama Harlots came with some full-on sex scenes for ex-Downton star Jessica Brown Findlay, but she managed to break the ice quickly.</p><p>“I found it was quite amusing if you put a whoopee cushion underneath someone,” she told Radio Times.</p><p>Oscar-winning Olivia Colman managed to lighten the mood during a sex scene with Emma Stone in 2018 film The Favourite – by placing a wet sponge between her legs.</p><p>Olivia said on The Graham Norton Show: “I put a sponge there and I said, ‘It’s all right, there’s a barrier, you’ll be fine’. It was a big wet sponge.”</p><p>Keira Knightley has filmed her share of sex scenes, but her role as psychoanalyst Sabina Spielrein in 2011 historical drama A Dangerous Method saw them become very X-rated.</p><p>The 35-year-old actress recalled: “We had a couple of shots of vodka before doing the scene – and a couple of glasses of champagne afterwards.”</p><p>There are few actors who have had to master the art of sex scenes quite like Fifty Shades Of Grey star Jamie Dornan – and he has his own flesh-coloured prop to keep him decent.</p><p>Jamie, 38, told GQ mag: “As a guy you put all your essentials in a little bag and you tie it up like a little bag of grapes.”</p><p>Allison Williams – Marnie Michaels in HBO comedy drama Girls – came up with an ingenious solution for coping with one of the most jaw-dropping scenes of the series.</p><p>When her co-star Ebon Moss-Bachrach had to get a very close look at her bottom, she asked the crew to make her “smell like cake” by coating the concerned area in vanilla cream.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Normal People sets pulses racing with steamy sex scene</span><p><strong>GOT a story?
