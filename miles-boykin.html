He just had to get stronger so that he could get off press coverage and be able to bring his body in use. He always had sizeable hands, great concentration.”</p><p>“It was just getting his body to a level up to where it needs to be able to play a full season.”</p><p>He adds, ” Miles has still not matched his potential fully, which is exciting. It’s just his overall work ethic and the approach he took every single day to practice has really headed him have the season he’s had this year.”</p><p><span>How Tall is Miles Boykin?
