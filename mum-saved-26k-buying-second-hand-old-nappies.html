it's how I've been brought up and I find it a fun side-project," Helen said.</p><p>"When Richard and I met he was a typical bloke who would just buy new for ease - but I soon changed that.</p><p>"All the furniture in <span id=b46638ce-7768-49ae-bbf0-35e630653759 class=suggested-link>our house</span> is second-hand -

by utilising Facebook groups where members post things they're looking to quickly flog, as well as FreeCycle and car boot sales.</p><p>It didn't stop at furniture, as Helen found baby clothes and even cloth nappies on second-hand sites that were in good condition, if not new, which she would throw into the washing machine before using.</p><p>According to <a href=# aria-label="Money Helper (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Money Helper</a>, parents can make an average overall saving of £1475 per child if they switch to reusable nappies.</p><p>The money-savvy mum is a magpie for clothing bundles while in <a href=#>charity</a> shops and car <span id=42225406-3c57-4dae-87b1-6c0b295883d3 class=suggested-link>boots</span> that have seen her bag 10 babygrows for £10 and a handful of newborn outfits for £15.</p><p>Helen has even managed to bag some premium items like pre-loved Joules baby clothes like tops, babygrows and even hats costing £10 in car boot bundles and Jellycat stuffed animals like bunnies costing £5 each, which usually retail at £23.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Helen's top bargains</h3></p><p>Sofa Habitat corner dark green sofa -

especially twins - isn't cheap with all the outfits, toys and furniture but it's definitely doable.</p><p>"We were able to use everything of Isacc's for the twins too, we only had to get another cot -which was free- and a double stroller costing £250.</p><p>"If I have a spare moment in between tasks or after I've put the tribe to bed, I'll have a <span id=a3322ca3-ea80-4686-a389-61e84363a2b6 class=suggested-link>power</span> hour on Vinted or Facebook Marketplace."</p><p>The former circus dancer also estimates she's saved over £10,000 on furnishing in her house with bargains such as a plush Habitat sofa for £300, a chic dresser for £20 from Facebook Marketplace, a bespoke mirror for £10 from a local boutique.</p><p>The only things Helen won't buy second-hand are mattresses and child's car seats, which she and Richard will opt to buy brand new.</p><p>Helen said: "I always keep up to date with upcoming car boot sales too as I find them even cheaper than the sites.</p><p>"I want to show my children the value of <span id=ce94fc4f-119c-43e3-9b13-c5cc6ff49d1e class=suggested-link>money</span> and that <span id=4f0d6f7f-c658-41ff-ad83-df98dba97d71 class=suggested-link>nice</span> things don't have to always be brand new.</p><p>"You can have a nice home on a budget and still dress in a way that makes you feel good.</p><p>"I love treating myself to a new dress or jumper- as long as its price tag matches."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Helen -
