At around 9:30 p.m. on March 3, the 33-year-old left a friend's home in south London to walk home.</p><p>Though no circumstances ever warrant an attack, a multitude of people pointed out that Everard took numerous precautions to get home safely. She wore brightly colored clothing (including sneakers), made her journey well before midnight on a weeknight, spoke to her boyfriend on the phone while walking, and took a route that was well-lit and on main roads.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite all of this, Sarah Everard never made it home.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>An officer and a woman were arrested in connection to the disappearance, and on suspicions of murder. Human remains were identified as Everard's on March 12.&nbsp;</p><p>Users connected with Everard's story, and they pointed out that there's an unspoken rule book that many follow when they are trying to walk alone.&nbsp;</p><p>In the days that followed her disappearance, several hashtags began trending. They include #NotAllMenButAllWomen, #SheWasWalkingHome, and #TextMeWhenYouGetHome.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sarah Everard, a marketing account manager, went missing after visiting a friend. She is believed to have walked through Clapham Common towards her Brixton home - a journey that should have taken her about 50 minutes. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3ddH2jb80e</a></p>— BBC South East (@bbcsoutheast) <a href=#>March 10, 2021</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the meaning of all the "Text Me When You Get Home" posts?</h2><p>Since Everard's disappearance on March 3, women all over the world have been sharing their stories about what they do in order to feel safe when walking alone, or what measures they take to check on their friends who do so.&nbsp;</p><p>One common message that they reference in their tweets, posts, or statements is that they say "Text Me When You Get Home." It represents a phrase people often say before someone leaves a party, gathering, or any other get-together.&nbsp;</p><p>Getting this type of text can confirm one's safe return.&nbsp;</p><p>Influencer Lucy Mountain shared a now-viral screenshot of a WhatsApp message on her Instagram feed, which read, "Text me when you get home xx."</p><p>In her caption, she articulated how women know what this type of text really means.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I've had conversations about how being hyper-conscious of our safety is just something we've done throughout our entire lives," she wrote in part of her caption. "The deep sense of connection is one of fear. We have all shared our live locations. We have all changed our shoes. We have all held our keys between our fingers. We have all made phone calls, both real and fake. We have all tucked our hair inside our coats. We have all ran down dark roads. We have all theorized our escape routes."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately, Sarah Everard did not get to send one of these messages on that fateful March evening.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Lucy, other users online have been pointing out that "Text Me When You Get Home" is habitual and second-nature, and it's become a replacement for "Bye." Many wondered if men ever feel a need to say it to one another.</p><p>In addition to the texts, women have shared the other ways in which they make themselves feel more comfortable when they travel alone.&nbsp;</p><p>This includes carrying their keys between their knuckles (in case they need a weapon to fight someone off), staying on a phone call during the entire duration of their walk, leaving while it's still light out, altering their path home to be on well-lit streets, and sharing their location to friends via their phones.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>A multitude of people have also posted screenshots of messages they've sent to friends or loved ones when they feel unsafe, or when they believe that someone is following them. They also chronicle other precautions, like ducking into stores, quickly changing paths, or asking friends to be ready to call the authorities on their behalf.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“Text me when you get home safe” is something I say to women I know before we part ways, and I’ve never thought about it. When I’m actually saying is that I worry something awful might happen to them and I won’t stop worrying until I know they’re safe. It shouldn’t be this way.</p>— Miriam Brett (@MiriamBrett) <a href=#>March 10, 2021</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>These messages highlight the fact that there is often a concern when a woman is by herself, no matter the time of day or the distance of the journey. There's an emphasis on hyper-vigilance, and one comfort is having a tight inner circle of friends to check in with.</p><p>The goal of sharing these stories is so that actions will be taken to further ensure the safety of women. The hope is that, one day, all people can feel comfortable walking alone at night, regardless of the hour.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbK5wIymnGavmJq7bsXOrmSgnaRitbC5xGaknpmenruo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftext-me-when-you-get-home-meaning.html&text=%26quot%3bText%20Me%20When%20You%20Get%20Home%26quot%3b%20Meaning%20%20The%20Sarah%20Everard%20Story&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftext-me-when-you-get-home-meaning.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftext-me-when-you-get-home-meaning.html&title=%26quot%3bText%20Me%20When%20You%20Get%20Home%26quot%3b%20Meaning%20%20The%20Sarah%20Everard%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftext-me-when-you-get-home-meaning.html&title=%26quot%3bText%20Me%20When%20You%20Get%20Home%26quot%3b%20Meaning%20%20The%20Sarah%20Everard%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftext-me-when-you-get-home-meaning.html&title=%26quot%3bText%20Me%20When%20You%20Get%20Home%26quot%3b%20Meaning%20%20The%20Sarah%20Everard%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftext-me-when-you-get-home-meaning.html&description=%26quot%3bText%20Me%20When%20You%20Get%20Home%26quot%3b%20Meaning%20%20The%20Sarah%20Everard%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./41-days-stranded-at-sea-the-harrowing-heartbreaking-real-life-story-behind-new-movie-adrift.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="41 Days Stranded at Sea">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./d1xdkot5uh339gzvfklf-o6y65b-yaed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
