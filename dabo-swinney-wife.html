However, by that time, it had spread to Lisa’s brain and lungs.</p><p>Lisa died in April 2011 after a protracted fight with the illness. Later, after consulting with a genetic counselor, Kathleen Bassett discovered that she and her other sister, Ann, had a 90% probability of developing cancer later in life.</p><p>Thus, Kathleen underwent a double mastectomy to reduce her risk of developing breast cancer.</p><p>She had a hysterectomy after a few years to minimize her chances of developing ovarian cancer.</p><h2>Kathleen Bassett: Social Works&nbsp;</h2><p>Kathleen Bassett has been a part of several cancer awareness campaigns.
