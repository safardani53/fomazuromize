Kelly</strong></a> collaborations on her resume — both of which she says she was pushed to do by her former record label RCA.</p><p>The 30-year-old singer discussed her 2019 decision to leave RCA during the Tuesday, September 12, episode of the <a href=#>Zach Sang Show</a>. After several years of working independently, Tinashe signed with Nice Life Recording Company in July.</p><p>“It felt like a perfect meeting of people who really understand and respect my artistry,” <a href=#>she said of moving</a> to Nice Life, which is also home to <a href=#><strong>Lizzo</strong></a>. “I didn’t feel like I was pressured to mold, change, make any of those things that felt label-y.”</p><p>When asked whether the duets with Brown, 34, and Kelly, 56, felt like one of those “label-y” things, Tinashe said they did.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tinashe-Regrets-Her-Unreal-Collaborations-With-R-Kelly-and-Chris-Brown-2.jpg><p>“You think I wanted to [do those songs]?” she asked host <strong>Zach Sang</strong>. “I literally block out that R. Kelly song from my mind. I forget that that even exists. That is so embarrassing. That is so unreal that I even have a song with R. Kelly. That’s so embarrassing! Yes, that was label-y.”</p><p>Her duet with Kelly, “Let’s Be Real Now,” appeared on his 2015 album, The Buffet. “I was so young too,” Tinashe added. “I feel like I did that song when I just signed to that label. I was probably 20. That was crazy.”</p><p><span>When Sang, 30, said it sounded like “you lack a lot of control in that situation,” Tinashe agreed. “A thousand percent. Especially when it comes to singles,” she said before recalling “Player,” her 2015 collaboration with Brown. “We all wanted it to be this big moment, this big single, so I feel like in their mind, they were like, ‘You need this support,’ and he was their biggest artist that they had on rhythmic radio at the time. To me, I was like, ‘Well, this is a pop song, so I really don’t feel like we should put Chris on it.’ That doesn’t compute to me, but I don’t know. Hindsight is 20/20.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She went on to say that she felt as though she could only “push back” against her label “so many times” before they would stop promoting her music. “There’s only so much that you can be like, ‘No, I’m not gonna do this because you want to be successful as well,’” Tinashe said. “You want to put your music out. If this is the way that I’m gonna be able to get my art out or my single out, then I’m just gonna have to commit to this. I’m just gonna have to convince myself that this is the right thing to do.”&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tinashe-Regrets-Her-Unreal-Collaborations-With-R-Kelly-and-Chris-Brown-3.jpg><p>After releasing her debut studio album, Aquarius, in 2014, Tinashe was outspoken about delays she faced while working on 2016’s Nightride and 2018’s Joyride. Meanwhile, she faced criticism from observers wondering why she chose to collaborate with Brown and Kelly, both of whom have been accused of violent crimes against women.</p><p>Kelly is currently <a href=#>serving 30 years in prison</a> after he was <a href=#>found guilty on nine counts</a> in New York. The 2021 conviction includes three counts of transportation across state lines for illegal sexual activity, four counts coercion and enticement and one count of transportation of a minor.</p><p>Last year, a Chicago jury found him guilty of <a href=#>three charges of child pornography</a> and three counts of enticing a child in a separate case. He was <a href=#>sentenced to 19 years in prison</a> to be served concurrently with his New York term plus an additional consecutive year, bringing his total sentence to 31 years.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Brown, for his part, pleaded guilty to one count of felony assault after beating former girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a> before the 2009 Grammys. He was sentenced to five years of probation as well as community service and domestic violence counseling.</p><p>If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, contact the <a href=#>National Sexual Assault Hotline</a> at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673). If you or someone you know are experiencing domestic violence, please call the <a href=#>National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuippGotaZ50Z6eq52kqHqpsdFmm66dpKh6uLXToWSrZZuaua3FjJqlnWWTnb%2Bqv4ybqaivnmQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftinashe-regrets-her-duets-with-r-kelly-and-chris-brown.html&text=Tinashe%20Regrets%20Her%20Duets%20With%20R.%20Kelly%20and%20Chris%20Brown&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftinashe-regrets-her-duets-with-r-kelly-and-chris-brown.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftinashe-regrets-her-duets-with-r-kelly-and-chris-brown.html&title=Tinashe%20Regrets%20Her%20Duets%20With%20R.%20Kelly%20and%20Chris%20Brown" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftinashe-regrets-her-duets-with-r-kelly-and-chris-brown.html&title=Tinashe%20Regrets%20Her%20Duets%20With%20R.%20Kelly%20and%20Chris%20Brown" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftinashe-regrets-her-duets-with-r-kelly-and-chris-brown.html&title=Tinashe%20Regrets%20Her%20Duets%20With%20R.%20Kelly%20and%20Chris%20Brown" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftinashe-regrets-her-duets-with-r-kelly-and-chris-brown.html&description=Tinashe%20Regrets%20Her%20Duets%20With%20R.%20Kelly%20and%20Chris%20Brown" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-rex-grossman-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Rex Grossman Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sammy-copley-20010316-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sammy Copley (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
