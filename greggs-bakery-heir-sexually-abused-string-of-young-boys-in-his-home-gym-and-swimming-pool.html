He is a wealthy and successful businessman and a charity fundraiser on a large scale.</p><p>“Furthermore he has spent much of his adult life working as a teacher, headmaster and children’s social worker.</p><p>“As Colin Gregg would have it, he dedicated his life to helping children realise their potential. And so, on the surface, Colin Gregg deserves the respect and thanks of our community.”</p><p>But Mr Greaney said beneath the surface Mr Gregg was “an abuser of children”, and during two periods about 20 years apart he engaged in the sexual abuse of boys, “always acting in breach of trust”.</p><p>The jury heard Gregg has faced allegations of sexual misconduct against boys in the past, but was not convicted.</p><p>Mr Greaney said: “It is the position of the prosecution that Colin Gregg has concealed his true nature beneath a veneer of respectability during his adult life and indeed, as we shall soon set out, it is, moreover, the prosecution case that he has exploited his position in society to perpetrate abuse.”</p><p>Between 1967-70, Gregg worked in the family business. His father, John Gregg, founded the famous and successful bakery chain.</p><p>Gregg taught at Durham School, a school in Newcastle’s west end before moving to Newcastle City Council’s children’s department as a social worker. He then became the headmaster at Tynemouth King’s School.</p><p>In 1989, Gregg became the director of children’s charity the Yellow Brick Road Fund.</p><p>During this time he operated a running club from his home at Homefarm Steading, Gosforth.</p><p>The jury was told Gregg stood trial in 1997 accused of indecently assaulting a boy while he was aged 10-14.</p><p>Gregg was acquitted at Newcastle Crown Court.</p><p>Mr Greaney said the allegations carry “hallmarks of his behaviour” across the years and across the two sets of complainants.</p><p>The allegations are “mutually supportive of each other”, according to the prosecution.</p><p>It's claimed&nbsp;the evidence from the original trial shows Gregg finds young boys physically attractive and he has a tendency to act on that attraction.</p><p>There are nine charges from four complainants, though the court will hear from six witnesses.</p><p>Prosecutors&nbsp;allege the boys suffered “disturbing abuse at the hands of someone they were entitled to trust”.</p><p>The first complainant, now in his 60s, claims Gregg sexually assaulted when he was aged 13 while he was at boarding school.</p><p>He told the jury: “It occurred in the swimming pool during a swimming lesson. I was in the pool, Mr Gregg approached me saying that he could improve my breast stroke by holding my legs.</p><p>“At that point I had my legs around his waist. At some point I realised that his hand moved inside my swimming trunks.”</p><p>At the time Gregg was involved with the charity TOC H, a Christian charity.</p><p>Another complainant accused Gregg of sexual abuse in 1996.</p><p>The prosecution claim the relationship was first “marked by kindness” and the complainant says he was allowed to steer Gregg’s car, like the other boys.</p><p>But Gregg started to molest him in the car and then in a sauna.</p><p>The final abuse took place in Gregg’s study, it is alleged.</p><p>The next complainant is also now aged 40.</p><p>He alleges that he was a victim of repeated abuse, starting late in 1988 or early in 1989, from when he was aged 11 or 12.</p><p>The alleged abuse started in the gym area at Gregg’s home. It would later occur in the shower, it is alleged.</p><p>Gregg would ask whether the alleged victim wanted shampoo, the boy would say yes and then Gregg would reach through the curtains and indecently assault him.</p><p>Gregg later abused him in his car, the jury heard.</p><p>The complainant says Gregg would massage his knees and legs with oil.</p><p>On one occasion, Gregg asked him to carry out a hamstring stretch.</p><p>While laying down on a sit up bench, he alleged Gregg indecently assaulted him.</p><p>Gregg denies nine counts of indecent assault.</p><p>The trial continues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4VxhJVpamifopq0qL%2BMm5iknaKueqmxyKtkrJ2oqq6tuNhmmJuto5qxbr%2FTq6Cnn12ks27Fzq6loGWSpMa0ecinZKGho2K1sLnEZp6ypV2Wu6V50rCgpqWZo7RuvM6oo2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgreggs-bakery-heir-sexually-abused-string-of-young-boys-in-his-home-gym-and-swimming-pool.html&text=Greggs%20bakery%20heir%20%27sexually%20abused%20string%20of%20young%20boys%20in%20his%20home%20gym%20and%20swimming%20pool%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgreggs-bakery-heir-sexually-abused-string-of-young-boys-in-his-home-gym-and-swimming-pool.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgreggs-bakery-heir-sexually-abused-string-of-young-boys-in-his-home-gym-and-swimming-pool.html&title=Greggs%20bakery%20heir%20%27sexually%20abused%20string%20of%20young%20boys%20in%20his%20home%20gym%20and%20swimming%20pool%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgreggs-bakery-heir-sexually-abused-string-of-young-boys-in-his-home-gym-and-swimming-pool.html&title=Greggs%20bakery%20heir%20%27sexually%20abused%20string%20of%20young%20boys%20in%20his%20home%20gym%20and%20swimming%20pool%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgreggs-bakery-heir-sexually-abused-string-of-young-boys-in-his-home-gym-and-swimming-pool.html&title=Greggs%20bakery%20heir%20%27sexually%20abused%20string%20of%20young%20boys%20in%20his%20home%20gym%20and%20swimming%20pool%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgreggs-bakery-heir-sexually-abused-string-of-young-boys-in-his-home-gym-and-swimming-pool.html&description=Greggs%20bakery%20heir%20%27sexually%20abused%20string%20of%20young%20boys%20in%20his%20home%20gym%20and%20swimming%20pool%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./scrooge-headmistress-cancelled-christmas-banning-nativity-play.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scrooge headmistress 'cancelled' our kids' Christmas by BANNING the Nativity play">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./noel-clarkes-bulletproof-co-stars-harassment-claims.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Noel Clarke's Bulletproof co-stars brand him 'sexual predator' and say sex allegations 'industry's b">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
