The pair have now been happily married for more than 30 years, having wed in 1991, and they share two sons: Lukas and Micah Nelson, who are also musicians.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While D'Angelo likes to keep a pretty low profile, Nelson has frequently shared how much she means to him. "When it came to romance, I had a gift for complicating things. But marrying Annie wasn't complicated at all. It's about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the smartest thing I ever did</a>. I can say that because, 34 years after we first met, we're still together and going strong," he wrote in his 2020 joint memoir Me and Sister Bobby: True Tales of the Family Band.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nelson offered her more praise in a May 2023 interview with PEOPLE. "I call her my pet rattler," he said. "She's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>my lover, my wife, nurse, doctor, bodyguard</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, who is Willie Nelson's wife?

D'Angelo was 30 at the time, and Nelson was 53.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My love for Annie was all-consuming, but winning her over wasn't easy," Nelson wrote in his memoir Me & Sister Bobbie.

Nelson officially divorced his third wife Connie Koepke in 1988.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-a-mom-of-two></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She's a mom of two</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rick Diamond/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">D'Angelo and Nelson share two sons: Lukas and Micah. Lukas Autry was born on Dec. 25, 1988, with Jacob Micah following on May 24, 1990. Like their father, both Lukas and Micah are musicians, and both have played with their father as well as pursued their own musical careers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nelson <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>spoke about his musical sons</a> during an interview with PEOPLE in May 2023. "We've got a couple of great kids," Nelson said. "I am proud of them and all they're doing on their own. It's great to have your kids with you at any time, but if they're on the stage singing with you and they're good, that makes it even better."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In December 2023, Lukas and Micah performed alongside their father during the televised celebration of his 90th birthday which was filmed earlier that year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">D'Angelo is also a stepmother.

I'm pretty temperamental, you know. I've been used to doing things my own way for so long that I'm not interested in any suggestions ... There was friction with my other wives.

They also have a home in Maui, Hawaii — a spot where they raised their two sons, but also where Nelson likes to host his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>infamous poker nights</a>, often attended by celebrity friends like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Woody Harrelson</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Kacey Musgraves</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-had-her-own-line-of-edibles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She had her own line of edibles</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">D'Angelo launched her own line of high-quality, strictly dosed and clean edible chocolates in 2017 under the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Willie's Reserve</a> label, including flavors like Maui Espresso Bean and Roasted Cacao Nibs. "Partnering with the very best growers and retailers is a win-win," she shared of her line at the time. "Our partners put the same love and care into their businesses as we put into our Infused Chocolates with healthy ingredients and the finest chocolate available."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The thing about edibles is you need to know what you're getting into. Annie's chocolates are clean, I trust the dosage and I happen to love them," Nelson, who is well known for his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>love of marijuana</a>, said in a statement.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-played-the-role-of-chef-and-nurse-during-the-covid-19-pandemic></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She played the role of chef and nurse during the COVID-19 pandemic</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gary Miller/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">D'Angelo kept the Nelson compound running during the earliest days of quarantine; she served as the grocery-getter, egg-collector and main chef, coming up with a weekly meal schedule for her family, and "turned the house into a hospital" when Nelson contracted COVID-19 in May 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Nelson got sick, D'Angelo sprang into action. "I had a nebulizer on the bus," she told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Times</a>. "I started everything I could at that point, including Paxlovid. He had the monoclonal antibodies. He had steroids." The couple then left the tour and went back to their Texas home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We turned the house into a hospital," she shared. "There were a couple of times when I wasn't sure he was going to make it." Thankfully, the then-89-year-old icon recovered, but D'Angelo set up strict guidelines to keep her husband protected. "If I have to be the bad guy to keep him safe, I'll be the bad guy," she explained of testing and masking rules implemented after he fell ill. "A virus doesn't care who you are, what you believe, how famous you are."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Okwq%2FA0bJmsKCfYra0ecCnpaKdXZmur7PEpaZmr5mhuaqxjKecpaufo3q4tcWeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-annie-dangelo-willie-nelson-wife.html&text=Who%20Is%20Willie%20Nelson%27s%20Wife%3f%20All%20About%20Annie%20D%27Angelo&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-annie-dangelo-willie-nelson-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-annie-dangelo-willie-nelson-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Willie%20Nelson%27s%20Wife%3f%20All%20About%20Annie%20D%27Angelo" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-annie-dangelo-willie-nelson-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Willie%20Nelson%27s%20Wife%3f%20All%20About%20Annie%20D%27Angelo" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-annie-dangelo-willie-nelson-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Willie%20Nelson%27s%20Wife%3f%20All%20About%20Annie%20D%27Angelo" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-annie-dangelo-willie-nelson-wife.html&description=Who%20Is%20Willie%20Nelson%27s%20Wife%3f%20All%20About%20Annie%20D%27Angelo" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kyle-unfug-btmc-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kyle Unfug (Radio Host) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-bernadette-sembrano-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Bernadette Sembrano Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
