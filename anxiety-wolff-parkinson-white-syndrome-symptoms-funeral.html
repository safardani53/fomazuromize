No one expects to be having heart surgery at 24."</p><p>The proposed procedure aims to cure the disease by fusing the hole in her heart back together.</p><p>But the risks are high. There's a one in 200 chance Maggie could have a heart attack during the <a href=#>operation</a>, and a one in 1,000 possibility she will die.</p><p>However, her odds of survival without it are much lower.</p><h2>'WHY ME?'</h2><p>"When I first heard the risks, I was absolutely terrified," she said.</p><p>"I just kept thinking, 'I am way too young for this', and about all the things I haven't yet done.</p><p>"When I got home from the hospital, I think I cried about it on and off for three days.</p><p>"I remember thinking, 'Why me? I am healthy and I have always taken care of my body - so how did this happen to me?'</p><p>"It did bring me some sort of peace knowing I was born with it, so actually there wasn't anything I could have done differently.</p><p>"But the emotional toll has been quite a lot. It's one thing to process a heart condition at a young age, but surgery with a high risk of death is another thing.</p><p>"It's a scary thing to go through at any age, but to go through it while you've got so much life ahead of you and so much left you want to achieve, is another type of fear."</p><p>The terror pushed Maggie to create a will and start planning her own funeral.</p><p>"I've made a list of things to do with the service and all my belongings just in case," she said.</p><p>"I have also written letters to people with my final words to them."</p><p>I was absolutely terrified.
