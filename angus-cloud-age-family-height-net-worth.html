In a short time, he also garnered millions of followers on his social media handles – he has over 7.1 million followers on Instagram only.</p><p>But how did he gain such fame? Well, through his amazing acting performance in the coming-of-age HBO show, <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/euphoria/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Euphoria</a>. In the show, he portrays the role of Fezco, aka Fez – a kind-hearted drug dealer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Angus Cloud is no longer alive</h2><p>The Euphoria fandom has been in shock since the morning after it was revealed that Cloud is dead. <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/31/euphoria-star-angus-cloud-dead-dies/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> was the first outlet to report the news, which has since been confirmed by Cloud’s family, friends, and co-stars.</p><p>As per the outlet, Cloud’s mother called 911 on Monday, June 31, 2023, which was picked up by Oakland PD and Fire Dept. Cloud’s mother told the operator that her son possibly overdosed and didn’t have a pulse. The actor was ultimately declared dead on the scene.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/angus-cloud-age-family-height-net-worth.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Angus Cloud during the premiere of HBO’s ‘Euphoria’ (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>Coming over to Cloud’s official cause of death, it’s still being investigated and thus remains unknown. Currently, his family has released a statement reading, “It is with the heaviest heart that we had to say goodbye to an incredible human today.”</p><p>“As an artist, a friend, a brother and a son, Angus was special to all of us in so many ways. Last week he buried his father and intensely struggled with this loss. The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend.”</p><p>“Angus was open about his battle with mental health, and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence. We hope the world remembers him for his humor, laughter and love for everyone,” they added.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In the end, Cloud’s family asked for privacy during this difficult time as they were still processing this devastating loss.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-old-is-angus-cloud>How old was Angus Cloud?</h2><p>At the time of his sudden death, Cloud was 25 years of age. Born in 1998, he celebrated his birthday every year on July 10. His zodiac sign is Cancer. He was raised in the suburbs of Oakland, California. Likewise, his birth name was Conor Angus Cloud Hickey.</p><p>Cloud celebrated his 25th birthday, aka his last birthday, on July 10, 2023, alongside his friends. And on July 13, he posted a picture from that special day, in which he was seen showing a middle finger. He wrote, “it was my buhddah ruskis bday cheers.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Talking about his education, he initially attended a regional school. Later, he enrolled at the Oakland School for the Arts in the School of Production Design – the same as his co-star <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/zendaya/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya</a>.</p><p>As per his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with GQ Magazine</a>, Cloud focused on technical theater at the acting academy and spent his time building the sets and lighting the stage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=angus-cloud-has-irish-family-roots>Angus Cloud had Irish family roots</h2><p>Cloud was a private person and preferred to keep his family details under wraps. Due to that, the details of his family remained unknown for a long time. And it could still be said when it comes to the details of his mother, whose name is Lisa Cloud Mclaughlin.</p><p>That said, it has been reported that his father’s name was Conor Hickey. Cloud’s death came sometime after his father passed due to health complications on May 18, 2023. A source has stated that Cloud had severe suicidal thoughts ever since his dad’s death.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Besides that, there aren’t many details known about his family, including if he has any siblings or not. As for his ethnicity, the actor told in his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with WSJ Magazine</a> in July 2019 that he is Irish and that all of his family members still reside in Ireland.</p><p>The disclosure of his family came when Cloud mentioned that before he was cast in Euphoria, he was planning to move to Ireland with his family for a while. His words were, “I was gonna move to Ireland for a while. All my family lives out there.”</p><p>As he continued, he told the Magazine that he had intended to “live out there, be working.” However, his fate changed when he was cast in the HBO Max hit show, and he continued to reside in the United States.</p><p>Although he hasn’t disclosed any further details about his family, reports suggest that his parents are professors by profession.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Angus-Cloud-Euphoria-1.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Angus Cloud in ‘Euphoria’ season two. (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>As his family is from Ireland, he has Irish roots from his parents, and his ethnicity is reported to be British. But, as he was born and raised in the United States, he holds American nationality.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-tall-is-angus-cloud>How tall is Angus Cloud?</h2><p>As of this writing, Cloud’s exact height remains unknown. His <a href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3783307/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDb profile</a> states that he stands at a towering height of 5 feet 11 inches or 1.8 meters. However, other outlets have reported him to be 5 feet 8 inches or 1.72 meters tall.</p><p>Likewise, netizens have also been asking if Clould had any tattoos on his body. And while many people would think that he would have one, the truth seems to be the other way. Cloud didn’t have any tattoos on his body. And if he had, they weren’t visible to the public eye.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=euphoria-is-angus-cloud-s-first-acting-gig>‘Euphoria’ was Angus Cloud’s first acting gig</h2><p>Although Cloud had attended an acting school, he was yet to make his acting debut. He used to work at a chicken-and-waffles restaurant close to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>One day, he was walking down a Manhattan street when he was stopped by a female representative who claimed she was working for a casting company. The representative was Jennifer Venditti, and she asked him if he would come in to read for a new TV show – Euphoria.</p><p>Cloud was initially confused and thought that Venditti was scamming him. In his interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GQ Magazine</a>, he said, “I was confused and I didn’t want to give her my phone number. I thought it was a scam.”</p><p>However, he gave her his phone number and went to the read. When he was there, he saw some serious people sitting across a nondescript room and immediately realized that it wasn’t a scam.</p><p>After the first reading, he was called again for the second reading, and this time it was with the show’s pilot director, Augustine Frizzell. His performance impressed the directors, and he was cast to play the role of Fezco in Euphoria.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Angus-Cloud-Wiki-Bio.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Angus Cloud initially thought he was being scammed when asked to read for ‘Euphoria.’ (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>He canceled his plan to move to Ireland and went to Los Angeles, where he began shooting the first season of Euphoria for around eight months. And although everything was happening in real-time, everything felt surreal for Cloud.</p><p>When the show aired on June 16, 2019, it received an overwhelming response from the audience, critics, and basically everyone. Later, the show was renewed for a <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/entertainment/euphoria-season-2/ rel="noreferrer noopener">second season</a> and premiered on HBO Max on January 9, 2022.</p><p>Moreover, on February 4, 2022, it was announced that Euphoria was renewed for a third season. At the time of the confirmation, it was sure that Cloud would appear as a series regular.</p><p>However, it’s now unknown how much he was already involved with the third season and if had done any filming. If he had done any filming, he would surely be featured, and if not, it’s good to assume that the show will pay him a good tribute, as he was one of the fan favorites.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Coming over to Cloud’s <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3783307/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acting gigs</a> following his big break, he made a cameo in the 2019 TV show The Perfect Women and played the role of Walker in the 2021 movie titled North Hollywood and Robert DeWitt in 2023’s The Line.</p><p>He had also worked on the upcoming movie, Your Lucky Day, which is already completed. Furthermore, he was also working on Freaky Tales, which is currently in post-production, and was reported to be a part of an Untitled Monster Thriller for Universal Pictures.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-much-is-angus-cloud-s-net-worth>How much was Angus Cloud’s net worth?</h2><p>Although he made his presence felt in the entertainment industry, Cloud was still a newbie and only had four acting gigs to his name. So, it’s evident that he might not have a huge net worth compared to his co-stars.</p><p>As per <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/angus-cloud-net-worth/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Cloud had an estimated net worth of $2 million before his sudden death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wJyrqKpflruowdJmmqWnpZl6orPEZp2apZmhxm60xKKeoaxdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fangus-cloud-age-family-height-net-worth.html&text=Know%20Angus%20Clouds%20Death%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Tattoos%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fangus-cloud-age-family-height-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fangus-cloud-age-family-height-net-worth.html&title=Know%20Angus%20Clouds%20Death%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Tattoos%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fangus-cloud-age-family-height-net-worth.html&title=Know%20Angus%20Clouds%20Death%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Tattoos%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fangus-cloud-age-family-height-net-worth.html&title=Know%20Angus%20Clouds%20Death%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Tattoos%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fangus-cloud-age-family-height-net-worth.html&description=Know%20Angus%20Clouds%20Death%2c%20Family%2c%20Height%2c%20Tattoos%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./landon-barker-new-mother.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Landon Barker Wore an Identical Outfit as His New Mother">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./euromillions-results-numbers-march-10-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="EuroMillions results and numbers: National Lottery draw tonight, March 10">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
