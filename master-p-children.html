Here is an in-depth look at all of his children!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Romeo Miller</h2><p>Percy Romeo Miller, or Romeo Miller only, is the eldest child of Master P and Sonya C. He was born on August 19, 1989, and was initially raised in the suburbs of New Orleans, Louisiana.</p><p>Romeo followed the footsteps of his father since his childhood and used to go by his stage name Lil Romeo.

He can be found on Instagram, where he has presently garnered around 16,700 followers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Veno Miller</h2><p>Veno Miller is actually Master P’s late brother Kevin Miller’s son. He was born on July 16, 1991 — making him 10 days older than Vercy Miller.</p><p>Distractify reports that Master P adopted his brother’s son with Sonya C after Kevin’s death in a robbery in 1990.
