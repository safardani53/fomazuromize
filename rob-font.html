Although he hasn’t disclosed his parents’ names, they are known to be from a military background.</p><p>Both his father and mother were military-based and thus, met through that way.&nbsp;</p><p>As for his other family members, he has an older sister and a younger brother. All of them were born under strict supervision and had a good childhood.</p><p>However, the early days were full of shifting from one place to another, and mostly, his father used to be away from home.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, it was usually his mother and siblings at home. However, life took them to Japan, Malaysia, South Carolina, Virginia, New York, Louisiana, and Florida due to the long hours of duty and placement.</p><p>Font considers his hometown to be Tampa, where he spent his childhood the longest among all these places.&nbsp;</p><p>Altogether, there are no details about where and when he completed his education or majors and degrees.&nbsp;</p><h3>Introduction to Life&nbsp;</h3><p>Apparently, Font dismissed his high school after earning GED and making money. He had planned to earn and save then enter a community college for further studies.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, he was working as a pizza delivery guy during that time. As he delivered in the Tampa area, he saw fighters training inside a garage, which sparked his curiosity.</p><p>When the fighters kindly showcased him some moves, he already loved it.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, he started hitting the gym without choosing to go into the military, as most people expected due to his family background. After six months in the gym, he got his foremost chance to take a kickboxing fight.</p><p>Later, he moved to Massachusetts, where he had his first amateur fight. This story dates back to 2009, when he started training for his amateur career. All in all, Font posted a record of 3-1 for his amateur career.&nbsp;</p><h2>Rob Font | Professional Career&nbsp;</h2><p>In December 2011, Rob Font broke through the professional arena.

Therefore, Roman Salazar replaced him, who fought against Mitch Gagnon.</p><p>“I got in there, made my debut, I feel like I made a little splash, and then we got the Chris Beal fight at Foxwoods in September, but I got injured. For the October 4th fight in Halifax against Mitch Gagnon, then I tweaked something again, and I said I’ve got to chill out and take some time off. I decided to stay low-key, stay off social media, heal up a hundred percent and keep getting better. And that’s what I did.”<br>-Rob Font&nbsp;</p><h3>Return After the Gap</h3><p>Altogether, he appeared in 2016 and fought against Joey Gomez.

It does kind of cast a grey shadow. But the best guys, they get over that. But it just wasn’t his night.”<br>-Rob Font</p><h3>Rob Font vs. Ricky Simon&nbsp;</h3><p>On June 22, 2019, Font was to fight Cody Stamann, which Cody later withdrew due to his injury.
