The couple just purchased a new house.&nbsp;His wife raved over him, stating she is proud of him for the person he has grown into.&nbsp;She said that Redmayne exudes confidence in him that she has never seen before.</p><h2>His penalty save helped Australia qualify for the World Cup in Qatar in 2022</h2><p>Redmayne became a national hero in June after saving a penalty against Peru in the World Cup qualifying round.&nbsp;In the 121st minute, he came off the bench to replace Brighton’s Mathew Ryan as a substitute goalie.&nbsp;On every penalty shoot-out, Redmayne’s tactics of dancing around his goal line and moving from side to side to disrupt the opponent helped his team earn a spot in the World Cup.&nbsp;Redmayne recounted receiving a call from national goalkeeping coach John Crawley, who remarked before hanging up,</p><p>“Be prepared to save a penalty to advance us to the World Cup.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Andrew-Redmayne-1.jpg alt="Andrew Redmayne" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He described the experience as bizarre when speaking on Australia’s Today Show.&nbsp;He described his situation as unusual since he had such a little part in what was a four-year campaign.&nbsp;He also said that he seems to be receiving all of the attention, which does not suit him, but he is content to play a little part.&nbsp;Redmayne nearly gave up football due to self-doubt, and he even had a tryout with Arsenal when playing youth football with both the New South Wales Institute of Sport and the Australian Institute of Sport.</p><h2>The London club made him an initial offer</h2><p>However, they eventually decided to withdraw the offer and sign Wojciech Szczesny instead, and Redmayne joined his local club, the Central Coast Mariners, as a backup goalkeeper.&nbsp;When he was playing for Western Sydney Wanderers with self-doubt in 2016, he stated it was all eyes on them and he didn’t believe he handled the pressure or focus of playing with so many eyes on the team.&nbsp;He also suffered criticism, which caused him to question himself.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Andrew-Redmayne-2.jpg alt="Andrew Redmayne" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It’s difficult to know there’s so much criticism and skepticism about oneself, he remarked in an interview.&nbsp;It was just too much for him. It was about this time that he lost interest in the sport and decided to abandon it.&nbsp;He and his wife discussed pursuing university degrees and becoming elementary school teachers.&nbsp;He had also taken a Barista course and was about to retire at the age of 27 to work at a friend’s café when Sydney FC signed him up.&nbsp;He went on to say that all he needed was an arm around him and that Sydney FC’s locker room was and still is one of the greatest he’s ever been a part of because it’s so soothing and caring. He rediscovered his love of football.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Redmayne’s net worth is believed to be approximately $2 million as of December 2023.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYp5yimsRuvsSdpJqxnpp6tMDArZydZaSdrrV5x55ksJmjYq6ju9StZK2nXabCqsCMn6aorJKWua15zq6rZqeWYsCmuMVmm6itkql8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fandrew-redmayne-stated-that-he-was-about-to-quit-football-out-of-self-doubt.html&text=Andrew%20Redmayne%20Stated%20That%20He%20Was%20About%20To%20Quit%20Football%20Out%20Of%20Self-Doubt&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fandrew-redmayne-stated-that-he-was-about-to-quit-football-out-of-self-doubt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fandrew-redmayne-stated-that-he-was-about-to-quit-football-out-of-self-doubt.html&title=Andrew%20Redmayne%20Stated%20That%20He%20Was%20About%20To%20Quit%20Football%20Out%20Of%20Self-Doubt" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fandrew-redmayne-stated-that-he-was-about-to-quit-football-out-of-self-doubt.html&title=Andrew%20Redmayne%20Stated%20That%20He%20Was%20About%20To%20Quit%20Football%20Out%20Of%20Self-Doubt" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fandrew-redmayne-stated-that-he-was-about-to-quit-football-out-of-self-doubt.html&title=Andrew%20Redmayne%20Stated%20That%20He%20Was%20About%20To%20Quit%20Football%20Out%20Of%20Self-Doubt" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fandrew-redmayne-stated-that-he-was-about-to-quit-football-out-of-self-doubt.html&description=Andrew%20Redmayne%20Stated%20That%20He%20Was%20About%20To%20Quit%20Football%20Out%20Of%20Self-Doubt" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dangelo-russell-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hoops &amp;amp; Style [2023 Update]">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./zack-fairhurst-20000321-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zack Fairhurst (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
