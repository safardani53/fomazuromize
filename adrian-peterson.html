Peterson was born and grew up in Palestine, Texas, alongside his siblings.</p><p>As we move on to his childhood days, it was rather harsh on him as he experienced pain at a very young age.</p><p>Being a child, he was nicknamed “All Day” by his father, and back to that time, Peterson had his older brother Brian who meant the world to him.</p><p>However, their relationship was short-lived at just the young age of nine; a drunk driver killed Brian.</p><p>Back then, Peterson was a seven-year-old witnessing the accident while riding a bicycle, and of course, this very incident made him feel the real pain as a child, even leaving a trauma by the side.</p><p>Additionally, if we look into the parents, they too didn’t have a healthy relationship as they were divorced.</p><p>Peterson was born into a Christian family, and hence, the rules were always strict, like when he was beaten with a belt by his dad in front of twenty students in total.</p><h3>Childhood</h3><p>As he grew up, at the age of 13, Peterson’s father was arrested for money laundering in a crack cocaine ring. As a result, he was with his mother; thankfully, she was strong and managed to ensure his good times.</p><p>All in all, like Peterson, when he recalls his childhood, he only has positivity filled in him, looking back to the days as the foundation that made him stand where he is today.</p><p>“We are human, so we do go through the pain, and we struggle with things, but it’s all about how you respond to a situation. My whole life, I have been responding positively and keeping a positive mind, keeping God first in my heart, in my mind. No matter what wrong I’ve done, I know who sees the heart.”<br>– Adrian Peterson</p><h2>Adrian Peterson | Early Career & Education</h2><p>Peterson comes from an athletic family as his father and mother both are star athletes. Adrian’s father, Nelson, was a shooting guard for Idaho State, who was doing well until he got shot accidentally in his foot by his brother.</p><p>Furthermore, his father also stood as an assistant coach in the Anderson County Youth Football Program.</p><p>Likewise, Peterson’s mother, Bonita, was a three-time Texas state champion at&nbsp;Westwood High School. Back then, she used to be a sprinter and long jumper and even got an athletic scholarship for the&nbsp;University of Houston.</p><p>Hence, we can imagine how he chose his path primarily, and apart from it, his brother’s accident also served as a fire to focus on a specific path to not get disrupted by the trauma.</p><h3>High School</h3><p>Herewith, Adrian started early in his high school days, where he excelled in basketball, track races, and football. Peterson was enrolled in the Palestine High School, where he starred as a footballer the most.</p><p>Going on deeper for the sophomore year in high school, he wasn’t eligible for their varsity team and focused on his tracks as he bagged several medals.</p><p>During that time, he was immersed with 100 meters, 200 meters, triple jump, and long jump, and by the end, his best records were 10.19 seconds in the 100 meters, 21.23 seconds in the 200 meters, and 47.6 seconds in the 400 meters.</p><p>As Peterson played football in his junior and senior years, he attracted every single individual towards him.</p><p>Let’s have a quick glance at his statistics during those years. Peterson recorded 2,051 yards on 246 carries for his junior years, an average of 8.3 yards per carrying, and 22 touchdowns.</p><p>Following it, for his senior years, he had maintained 2,960 yards on 252 attempts, an average of 11.7 yards per carrying, and 32 touchdowns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Petersons-jersey-retires-with-him-from-Palestine-High-School-in-2004.jpg><h3>College</h3><p>With the high school coming to an end in 2004, Peterson partook in the annual&nbsp;U.S. Army All-American Bowl.</p><p>He posted 95 yards on nine carries and two touchdowns during the match, as he bagged the Hall Trophy as the U.S. Army National Player of the Year. In the meantime, he also announced his college choice to be the University of Oklahoma.</p><p>Prior to this, Rivals.com and Scout.com had named him the top five-star recruit, and he was titled the best running back the prospect of 2004. Therefore, during the choice-making process, he was confused between USC and Oklahoma.</p><h4>University of Oklahoma</h4><p>Peterson commenced his years in Oklahoma with Oklahoma Sooners Football under the coach Bob Stoops as he commenced the freshman years with 1,925 yards throughout the season.</p><p>Despite his injuries in the mid-way, Peterson led the team to become one of the nation’s best as he bagged several NCAA first-year students’ records.</p><p>All in all, Peterson was titled&nbsp;First-Team&nbsp;Associated Press&nbsp;All-American and even stood second&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Heisman Trophy voting behind&nbsp;USC&nbsp;quarterback&nbsp;Matt Leinart.</p><p>As he advanced to sophomore years, he got a limited time due to his injuries since the first year. During the Big 12 Conference, Peterson faced an injury; however, by the end of the season, he managed to be a member of the All-Big 12 Conference team.</p><p>Overall, this year too, he posted his career-long 84-yard touchdown as the Sooners stood third in the Big 12 behind the&nbsp;Texas Longhorns.</p><p>Advancing to the next year, for the first time in his early career, Peterson had his father as the spectator in his game on October 14, 2006.</p><p>His father was released from jail, and he was able to win over Iowa State in that same game but injuring his collarbone.</p><p>With this, he was unable to start in any further games of the season; hence, he closed the year’s chapter with 1,112 rushing yards.</p><h2>Adrian Peterson | Professional Career</h2><p>Afterward, as he finished the year 2006, he went on for the 2007 NFL Draft, and for his immense power and talent, he was always compared with Eric Dickerson,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter Payton</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gale Sayers</a>.</p><p>Later, on June 29, 2007, Minnesota Vikings signed Peterson with a five-year $40.5 million contract as they had $17 million guaranteed.</p><h3>Minnesota Vikings (2007-2016)</h3><p>With the Viking’s commencement in 2007, he spent nine years with them until the year 2016. In the meantime, Peterson had an outstanding rookie year as he made his game debut against St.</p><p>Louis Rams and had his career breakthrough against the Chicago Bears. During the match, he posted a then-franchise record of 224 rushing yards on 20 carries; thus, as he ended the season with 1,341 yards and 12 touchdowns.</p><p>Overall, he was also named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.</p><p>Simultaneously, in the 2008 Pro Bowl, Peterson became the first-ever rookie to win the Pro Bowl MVP Award. Following it in his sophomore years, he also led the league for the most passing ever since Eric Dickerson and Chris Johnson.</p><p>Along the journey, he had established his mark in the Vikings, and among all those years with them, the year 2012 is titled the best. Later, on February 28, 2017, Peterson was announced as a free agent, and the Vikings released him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Minnesota-Vikings.jpg><h3><span id=New_Orleans_Saints class=mw-headline>New Orleans Saints (2017)</span></h3><p>Right after his release, the New Orleans Saints dealt a two-year $7 million contract with Peterson, which included another $2.5 million as a signing bonus.</p><p>However, Peterson was only playing a few games in 2017 as he moved from the Saints with 81 yards.</p><h3>Arizona Cardinals (2017)</h3><p>Following it, the Saints traded Peterson to The Arizona Cardinals, where he made his debut for the team on October 17.</p><p>During his interval in the Cardinals until March, Peterson had posted 529 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, 11 receptions, and 70 receiving yards.</p><h3><span id=Washington_Redskins class=mw-headline>Washington Redskins (2018-2019)</span></h3><p>On August 20, 2018, Washington Redskins signed a year contract with Peterson as he also starred in the season opener of Redskins at Arizona Cardinals.</p><p>In the bargain, Peterson became one of the five players of 33 or above to have 1,000 yards in a season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Art-Rooney-Award-1024x576.jpg><p>Likewise, in 2019, Peterson had extended his contract for two years with $8 million.

So, what’s a groin? What’s an adductor? That’s how I look at things. I feel like if you just continue to take care of your body, working out, making sure you’re in shape, and you stay on top of your game, you can play as long as you want.”<br>– Adrian Peterson</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>As of 2020, the running back, Adrian Peterson, is reported to have a net worth of $4 million with an annual salary of $1 million.
