Why would 20 women put themselves through reliving their traumas to bring down an actor who isn't even a household name?

Bafta stripped him of the award on Thursday night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000621802951-2.jpg><p>On Monday, Jaime shared an image of Brit star Daniel Kaluuya, 32, collecting his Best Supporting Actor award for Judas and the Black Messiah at the Oscars with the caption: “Now that’s what you call Outstanding Contribution to film — man like Daniel, congratulations well-deserved #bafta #oscar.”</p><p>Outlander actress Rosie Day, 26, pictured with Clarke at a 2019 Bafta event, posted on Instagram: “I stand in solidarity with every single woman. When the abuser is ­welcome the victims are not.”</p><p>Last night ITV sensationally axed the fifth and final episode of Viewpoint in which Clarke plays surveillance cop DC Martin King.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000650200555-3.jpg><p>A spokesman for the broadcaster said: “In light of the very serious nature of the allegations against Noel Clarke raised by 20 women in The Guardian’s report, ITV has decided it is no longer appropriate to broadcast the final episode on ITV main channel this evening.</p><p>“We are mindful that some of our viewers have already invested four hours of their time over the past four nights in following this thriller which was due to conclude this evening, and they have yet to see the final episode.</p><p>"As such we plan to make it available on ITV Hub tonight for a limited time for any viewers who wish to seek it out, and watch its conclusion.”</p><p>The episode will be available on the Hub until Sunday night but won’t be made available on any ITV platform after that.</p><p>The programme's Alexandra Roach also broke her silence and reached out to female victims of abuse following the allegations against Clarke.</p><p>The actress, 33, says she "sees, hears and believes" women of sexual crimes, adding that she does not want to work with "sexual predators".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000626935048-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000650618750.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000650412417-2.jpg><p>It is understood neither ITV nor its producers Tiger Aspect, received any complaints about Clarke’s behaviour during the making of the show.</p><p>The statement also said: “ITV has a zero-tolerance policy to bullying, harassment and victimisation and robust procedures in place to investigate and deal with any complaints. We strongly believe that everyone deserves to work in a supportive and safe environment.”</p><p>Sky’s fourth series of Bulletproof was due to start later this year, but a question mark now hangs over the project.</p><p>A spokesman said: “Sky stands against all forms of sexual harassment and bullying and takes any allegations of this nature extremely seriously.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000650415166-2.jpg><p>"Effective immediately, we have halted Noel Clarke’s involvement in any future productions.”</p><p>Bafta has said it was alerted to the claims against Clarke 13 days before the ceremony.
