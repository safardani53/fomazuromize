At the age of 15, she walked the runway at New York Fashion Week, though her focus has always been on her education. "I am so proud, she's a good person, she's a good girl, in school she's getting all A's right now," Camille told Page Six at the time.

He is Grammer and Walsh's third child together and the actor's seventh child overall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a statement, the couple shared that their son's name "was chosen to honor the great poet W.H. Auden, and James is after another great poet and singer James Taylor — two of our favorites."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, "Ellis" is Grammer's great-grandfather's name. "He was a colorful character, to say the least," they said, adding, "we wanted to give the name a second chance." Like some of his siblings, the now-7-year-old goes by his middle name.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Grammer and Walsh prefer to keep James and his other siblings out of the public eye while they are still young, and they rarely share pictures of their children or speak about them publicly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmmqScYq6ju9StZKSdnKiyunnGq5impZWneqy1w6xm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fall-about-kelsey-grammer-kids.html&text=Kelsey%20Grammer%27s%207%20Kids%3a%20Everything%20to%20Know&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-about-kelsey-grammer-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-about-kelsey-grammer-kids.html&title=Kelsey%20Grammer%27s%207%20Kids%3a%20Everything%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fall-about-kelsey-grammer-kids.html&title=Kelsey%20Grammer%27s%207%20Kids%3a%20Everything%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fall-about-kelsey-grammer-kids.html&title=Kelsey%20Grammer%27s%207%20Kids%3a%20Everything%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-about-kelsey-grammer-kids.html&description=Kelsey%20Grammer%27s%207%20Kids%3a%20Everything%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nijiro-murakami-19970317-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nijiro Murakami (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kevin-durant-girlfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Kevin Durant Girlfriend?
