That hasn’t happened for a long time. That’s the dream, to get drafted. Every year, though, it’s not guaranteed. Sometimes not even a single punter gets drafted.

As per the news, Chrisman and Avery are childhood sweethearts.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, Eliason’s family moved to Lawrenceburg, Indiana, when she was just five years old. As they grew together, they also became closer initially as a friend.</p><p>It was only during those times when Avery was on a year-and-a-half mission to Peru.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Following it, the duo wrote to each other and had thriving feelings for each other. Later, they took a step out of their “friend zone” and started dating.</p><h3>Spring Game Proposal&nbsp;</h3><p>Back in April 2019, Drue Chrisman had the biggest turn in his life during the spring game.</p><p>Indeed, he proposed to his girlfriend, Avery, during halftime, which in no instant hit as one of the viral proposals. For every reason, it did stand as a ‘couple goal.’</p><p>In fact, Chrisman also portrayed one of the smoothest tricks for the proposal.</p><p>Without any suspicions for Avery, he managed to bring her on the field to kick a goal. Back then, Avery was watching the game from the stands.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, she was with the former Ohio State kicker Sean Nuernberger and his girlfriend.</p><p>Right then, as the halftime was announced, snapper Liam McCullough’s girlfriend (part of the OSU’s fan engagement team) asked Avery to participate in the kicking contest.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, Avery stood without any doubt and progressed with the very first kick she thought she was giving in her life.</p><p>Drue was kneeling to help Avery with the fake kick and, of course, more suitable for his proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, McCullough passed the ball while Drue held it in place. Right when she proceeded to kick, Drue signaled her to stop while discreetly reaching out for the engagement ring.</p><p>Indeed, romantic fairy tale moment!</p><p>Chrisman made his proposal, and Avery accepted it while the whole stadium roared for the congratulatory wishes. Additionally, Blake Haubeil came running to the couple for the wishes.&nbsp;</p><p>Way past the time, the duo had floods of wishes and roars in and out of the stadium while his proposal went viral worldwide.</p><p>Not to mention, they had floods of wishes and congratulatory notes all over the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t even think I heard her say yes. I blacked out a little, not gonna lie. Being able to do this in the stadium during the spring game … was just an incredible experience. I love this university so much, to be able to do it on that field that I’ve given so much to, I couldn’t have asked for a better experience.”<br>-Drue Chrisman&nbsp;</p><h4>Behind the Scenes</h4><p>With the great iconic moment, no fans and couple would ever forget, Chrisman did have to arrange many beforehand.</p><p>According to the sources, he had initially planned to propose to her during their first anniversary.&nbsp;</p><p>However, his friend suggested doing it during the spring game as it also marked his advancement to the third season as the Buckeyes’ starting punter.</p><p>In the end, the moment was ever so special, with a large crowd of Ohio State fans watching.</p><p>Right then, he had also stated that he might have even put the ring in a bottle and done a bottle flip with it at first.</p><p>He also stated that he was nervous during the gameplay about his halftime.&nbsp;</p><p>Nervousness also felt its way with Avery Eliason when she was asked to make the kick.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was nervous about kicking a ball in front of everybody. I’ve never done that before. But I didn’t really suspect anything other than that. I was planning just to kick the ball the best I could. I have been just feeling so much love from not only Drue but from everybody, family, and friends, and Buckeye Nation has just been so wonderful. Our hearts are so full.”<br>-Avery Eliason</p><p>Altogether, to make the proposal a success, Drue first gained the approval of Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith and head coach Ryan Day.</p><p>Furthermore, the special team’s coach also assisted him by holding out his ring for him during the game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Learn about<a href=# rel=noopener> Jordan Cameron: Net Worth, Sister, Stats, Wife, NFL>>>&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></strong></p><h4>Social Distancing Wedding&nbsp;</h4><p>The duo held out their wedding amidst the coronavirus outbreak the next year after the proposal.
