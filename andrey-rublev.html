Although his interest was partly inclined toward tennis, he still played basketball and boxed regularly.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Andrey-With-His-Sister-Source-Instagram.png><p>As a boy, Rublev looked up to his heroes <a href=# rel=noopener>Roger Federer</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Rafael Nadal,</a> Grigor Dimitrov, and Milos Raonic, to name a few.</p><p>He learned to play tennis through their unique plays, practiced and tweaked their technique to suit him better, and thus is on track to becoming the greatest tennis player.&nbsp;</p><h2>Age, Height, & Nationality</h2><p>Being born on the 20th of October, 1997, he is 26 years old as of November 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>The young man has got potential that could make him world-renowned. As he is an athletic man, his body stature is also like that of an athlete. And we can safely assume that the sports he plays have helped to boost his height too.</p><p>Andrey has a whopping height of 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m), which makes him quite tall than average.</p><p>However, most tennis players have a height of 6 feet (1.82 m) or more, so his size is quite moderate compared to other tennis players. Meanwhile, the amazing player weighs 75 kg (165 lbs).&nbsp;</p><p>Rublev was born and raised in Russia and had Russian citizenship.</p><h2>Career</h2><h3>Junior Career</h3><p>Rublev’s first-ever significant game was in Luxembourg when he was 13 years old. He got his first win in his second competition, which was held in Phoenix. In the coming years, he climbed up in the competition and won the Orange Bowl in 2012.</p><p>His first notable win was in 2014 when he won against Munar Clar in the French Open junior singles. Again in the Wimbledon championships, Rublev reached the third round before losing against Van Rijthoven.</p><p>In the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics, he won the bronze medal after beating Jumpei Yamasaki. Similarly, he also reached the finals in the doubles but lost to Brazilians Liz and Zorman.</p><p>His last junior tournament was the inaugural ITF Junior Masters in 2015, which he won by beating <a href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Fritz</a> in three sets.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Rublev’s professional career or senior career started in 2014 when he debuted in the Bulgaria F6 Futures. He slowly made his way to the big leagues. But that does not mean he won all the tournaments.</p><p>As a 15-year-old boy, he lost many games during the quarter-finals or semi-finals before grabbing a tournament win and his first win as a senior player at the USA F31 Futures, which was held in Bradenton, United States.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/274925733_1027755127810935_5982717293211505311_n.jpg><p>The year 2015 was both good and bad for the young boy.</p><p>Although he faced many losses, he made history by being one of the two under-18 players to win at least once in five ATP tournaments in one season.</p><p>This was a booster for him as it would help him grow more as a tennis player. He made his major league debut when he entered the 2015 U.S. Open as a qualifier.</p><p>Andrey won gold in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics in the mixed doubles title with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.&nbsp;</p><p>He has not won any Grand Slam tournament until now, but that is sure to change in the coming future. The young star has reached the quarter-finals six-times in his career.</p><p>He played in the quarter-finals in the 2017 U.S. Open, 2020 French Open, 2020 U.S. Open, Australian Open 2021, French Open 2022, and US Open 2022.&nbsp;</p><h3>ATP Titles&nbsp;</h3><p>Andrey set his foot on the career-high singles rankings of No. 5 by the ATP on 13 September 2021.</p><p>However, it was only in October 2020 he arrived in the top 10 of the ATP Tour. Talking about ATP single titles, he has grabbed 12 of them.</p><p>In 2017, he won his first ATP singles title, winning against Paolo Lorenzi in the final of the Umag Open.</p><p>Rublev won his second ATP title at the Kremlin Cup in 2019. The next year, he made a personal record by winning five ATP titles.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrey came across a career-high doubles ranking of No. 74 on January 6, 2020. He has notched two double titles to date.&nbsp;</p><p>He reached the semi-final for the first time at a Masters 1000 level at the 2021 Miami Open but sadly got knocked out by the eventual champion Hubert Hurkacz.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/316364213_1197259427863078_6031982082068668094_n.jpg><p>Nonetheless, in Monte Carlo, Andrey made it to his first singles Masters 1000 final, winning against 11-time champion Rafael Nadal.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he could not conquer Tsitsipas in the championship match, Rublev made it to a then-career-high of world No. 7 and outdid Roger Federer in the rankings.</p><p>Andrey also performed at the 2021 French Open (Rolland Garros), where he got upset in the first round by Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany in 5 sets.</p><p>At the 2021 Wimbledon, Andrey finished in fourth place for the first time in his career, overcoming 26th seed Fabio Fognini.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, he won four titles and reached the second Australian Open quarterfinal in 2023.&nbsp;</p><h3>Playing Style & Best Shots</h3><p>Not mentioning Andrey’s best shots would be a crime, so here we go. We all know that Andrey is an offensive baseliner with a good forehand grip.&nbsp;</p><p>Andrey has a menacing and continuous two-handed backhand. When it comes to using his forehand, he makes several passing shots and goes lethal as the consistency and comfort level is high.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Andrey, he does not refer to a particular tennis surface. His hyper-aggressive attitude sometimes leads to situations where he makes rapid errors followed by technical and mental difficulties.</p><p>His often first serves are powerful and reaches 200+ km/h (125+ mph). However, his second serve is a bit disappointing, slower than the first because of his high number of double faults.</p><p>Rublev’s most talked-about shots were when he outwitted Rafael Nadal at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters. During the same event, he earned the decisive break of serve against Casper Ruud with a buzzing backhand down the line.</p><p>Defeating Marton Fucsovics in the final, Rublev won the Rotterdam Open, which later opened his doors to a twenty-match winning streak at ATP Tour 500 tournaments.</p><h3>Tennis On A Clay Court</h3><p>World No.5 Andrey Rublev says,”Clay is the surface when it’s real tennis.”</p><p>Rublev had a strong start to the European Clay Court season, making it to the finals of the Monte Carlo Masters and the quarter-finals of the Barcelona Open.</p><p>The first time Rublev played on clay surfaces was at Trofeo Bonfiglio in Milan, and he became a quarter-finalist at the 2014 Australian Open junior singles.</p><p>At the doubles competition, he was teamed up with German Alexander Zverev, reaching the quarter-finals.</p><p>Andrey was overpowered by <a href=# rel=noopener>Jannik Sinner</a> in just over 90 minutes at the Barcelona Open 2021.</p><p>Following is the data extracted from tennislive.net regarding his clay record.</p><table width=501><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>Clay Record</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>2022</strong></td><td>14/6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2021</strong></td><td>9/5</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2020</strong></td><td>16/3</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2019</strong></td><td>8/5</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2018</strong></td><td>2/3</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2017</strong></td><td>11/11</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2016</strong></td><td>12/14</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2015</strong></td><td>12/10</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2014</strong></td><td>11/2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2013</strong></td><td>&nbsp;12/2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td>107/61</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Percentage</strong></td><td>63.69%</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Awards</h3><p>Andrey’s plays, skills, and talents have won him awards. He has put a lot of work into honing his skills and talent in the sport.</p><p>He was nominated for the Russian Cup Team of the Year junior award twice, once in 2013 and another in 2014.</p><p>In the year 2014, he was able to win the ITF Junior World Champion award, which is a pretty huge deal for a junior tennis player.</p><p>In 2019 and 2021, he won the Team of the Year award, playing in the national Russian Cup.</p><p>These awards show the player’s value, and it gives a significant margin of how good the player actually is.</p><p>Rublev could become one of the greatest players in tennis in the future if he goes on playing in his best way. He grabbed the ATP Most Improved Player in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>On 6 August 2021, he was called “Merited Master of Sports of Russia” and “Order of Friendship” on 11 August 2021.&nbsp;</p><h2>Salary & Net Worth</h2><p>Talented athlete Andrey Rublev has a staggering net worth of <strong>$5 million </strong>as of November 2023, and he has already become one of the most successful young players in the world.</p><p>His talents and skills have won him many matches and tournaments until now.
