No, he's got two pussycats on his arm," she ranted still not over their previous fight.</p><p>They eventually kissed and made up prior to heading on stage, but fans were still uncomfortable with how Nick treated his wife.</p><h2 id=fan-backlash>FAN BACKLASH</h2><p>One user commented: "Jessica needed a friend during that time. Everyone was so mean to her 😩"</p><p>While a second person thought that Nick's harsh words were out of line, writing: "My husband would never talk to me like that in front of my family."</p><p>Another agreed, adding: "I didn't realize how toxic he was to her until now as an adult."</p><p>A fourth person chimed in: "I don’t like how mean and condescending he always to her. She WAS young, always demeaning her for not being a woman"</p><p>And a slew of others echoed the statement, with one saying: He was so awful to her.</p><p>"Omgosh they where so toxic," wrote another.</p><p><a href=#>Nick and Jessica were married</a> from 2002 until 2006.</p><p>Their lives were filmed on the show from 2003 until it's final episode in 2005.</p><h2 id=telling-memoir>TELLING MEMOIR</h2><p>In her memoir Open Book, Jessica spoke about how their marriage unraveled after the pair filmed their reality show.</p><p>In February 2020, she explained, "I don't believe that the show is what tore our marriage apart."</p><p>"Nick and I were very great at being together publicly and on-camera. We were best at our relationship when we were singing together. I felt like we were at home in that place," Jessica continued.</p><p>"But as far as doing the reality show, we just kind of had fun with it until the end—until we started having marital problems."</p><p>Following the release of her book, Nick appeared on SiriusXM's Andy Cohen Live in November 2021,&nbsp;<a href=#>where he revealed he has no plans on reading his ex-wife's book</a>.</p><p>When Andy asked if he had read the book, Nick responded: "You’ll be shocked to hear that I have not. Nor will I ever read that book."</p><h2 id=moved-on>MOVED ON</h2><p>He continued: "I obviously knew the book was coming out, but I lived the book. You know what I mean.</p><p>"I know what the truth is so I don’t need to read it, or read someone’s version of it in a story that I know, that I lived it. No, I never read it."</p><p>Both have since moved on to new love interests as Nick married actress <a href=#>Vanessa Minnillo</a> in 2011 after five years of dating.</p><p>They went on to have three children together: Camden, nine, Brooklyn, seven, and Phoenix, five.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Jessica found love again with football player Eric Johnson who she wed in 2014.</p><p>They also share three children: Maxwell, nine, Ace, eight, and Birdie, two.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000003702451.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000713888645.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/02/NINTCHDBPICT000658638172.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsZ2mEc3yRaKGeq6OesKJ50qKkqaufo3qvtcKkZKWZk52yunnTqK%2Bim12isqK6jKecsKSprLKlv4yco6KoXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjessica-simpson-nick-lachey-toxic-mean-newlyweds-clip.html&text=Jessica%20Simpson%20fans%20slam%20her%20ex%20Nick%20Lachey%20for%20%27toxic%27%20and%20%27mean%27%20behavior%20in%20resurfaced%20Newlyweds&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjessica-simpson-nick-lachey-toxic-mean-newlyweds-clip.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjessica-simpson-nick-lachey-toxic-mean-newlyweds-clip.html&title=Jessica%20Simpson%20fans%20slam%20her%20ex%20Nick%20Lachey%20for%20%27toxic%27%20and%20%27mean%27%20behavior%20in%20resurfaced%20Newlyweds" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjessica-simpson-nick-lachey-toxic-mean-newlyweds-clip.html&title=Jessica%20Simpson%20fans%20slam%20her%20ex%20Nick%20Lachey%20for%20%27toxic%27%20and%20%27mean%27%20behavior%20in%20resurfaced%20Newlyweds" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjessica-simpson-nick-lachey-toxic-mean-newlyweds-clip.html&title=Jessica%20Simpson%20fans%20slam%20her%20ex%20Nick%20Lachey%20for%20%27toxic%27%20and%20%27mean%27%20behavior%20in%20resurfaced%20Newlyweds" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjessica-simpson-nick-lachey-toxic-mean-newlyweds-clip.html&description=Jessica%20Simpson%20fans%20slam%20her%20ex%20Nick%20Lachey%20for%20%27toxic%27%20and%20%27mean%27%20behavior%20in%20resurfaced%20Newlyweds" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./john-gruber.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Gruber">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./deen-bean.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Deen Bean Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Religion, Girlfriend">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
