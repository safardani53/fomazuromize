and cannot wear a uniform that corresponds with his previous positions in the forces - it's possible he'll instead wear a basic military uniform after his years of service.</p><p>Harry - who served in the Army for ten years, completed two tours of Afghanistan and was promoted to captain - was understood to be deeply upset by the decision to remove his titles.</p><p>He&nbsp;has now returned to the UK alone for the ceremony&nbsp;<a href=#>after his pregnant wife Meghan Markle was advised not to travel</a>.</p><p>The Duke was seen getting off a British Airways flight from Los Angeles that arrived at Heathrow at 1.15pm yesterday.</p><h2>BROTHERS 'WILL DRESS THE SAME FOR FUNERAL'</h2><p><a href=#>And his grandfather's funeral</a>&nbsp;will be his first ceremonial event since he and Meghan departed for the US.</p><p>But it was suggested that, while <a href=#>Prince Charles,</a>&nbsp;Prince William and Prince Edward would be expected to wear their ceremonial outfits for the service, Harry and his uncle, <a href=#>Prince Andrew</a>, would be likely to wear suits.</p><p>The Duke of York stepped back from public life "for the foreseeable future" in 2019 over his friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>However, Mr Fitzwilliams said the funeral will offer the family an opportunity for a "show of unity" after <a href=#>Harry and Meghan's "deeply damaging" Oprah interview.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000638456837.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000018291065-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000639453240.jpg><p>Mr Fitzwilliams said: "Everybody&nbsp;knows there is an enormous amount of speculation, whatever happens on this issue.</p><p>"Relations between the&nbsp;brothers, we know perfectly well, are very strained."</p><p>And the expert hopes the funeral may mark a new chapter for William and Harry.</p><p>"It may be the beginning of the healing process," he said.</p><p>"The Royal Family can come together as family, and it is certainly absolutely essential they present united front.</p><p>"Achieving that after the Oprah interview and so forth will be quite a feat, but I am sure that, given the circumstances, and given the fact that both Harry and William were devoted to their grandfather, there is a very very good chance of achieving it."</p><p>He said details for the funeral - including the outfits mourners will wear - will have been planned to the smallest details.</p><p>"There has been no announcement at all on that, so as a result, we simply don't know," he said.</p><p>"But I'd suggest all these details are being thought out -

It’s been more than a year now," they said.</p><p>The Queen&nbsp;<a href=#>must choose just 30 people to attend her beloved husband's funeral</a>, which will take place entirely within the grounds of Windsor on April 17.</p><p>The initial list - which stretched to around 800 - has been massively cut back as a result of the Covid crisis.</p><p>It's expected the Queen and Duke's great-grandchildren - including Princess Charlotte and her brothers - will be considered too young to attend.</p><p>Boris Johnson will not attend the service to allow another member of the family to go in his place.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>The grandchildren's other spouses -&nbsp;Mike Tindall,&nbsp;Jack Brooksbank&nbsp;and&nbsp;Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi&nbsp;- may attend to support their wives.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The funeral will be televised, with a national minute-long silence at 3pm.</p><p>Charles, William and Harry will join the funeral procession -
