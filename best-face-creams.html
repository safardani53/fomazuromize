It all depends on your skin type; for example, dry complexions need thicker formulas with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, whereas if your face is quite oily you'll want to opt for oil-free, water-based and non-comedogenic ointments.</p><p>The main purpose of face cream is to keep your face hydrated and give you a fresh base for applying makeup, although there are lots of creams that promise even more.</p><p>From anti-ageing gems to brightening best-sellers, we've reviewed some of the most popular, best face creams to shop now.

It's won 70 international awards and averages 4.7 stars on the brand's website. In short, it's got a pretty good reputation.</p><p>Touted as a 'super hydrator', it uses glacial glycoprotein and olive-derived squalane to ensure moisturised skin all day.</p><p>The cream looks very thick in the pot but once it's rubbed in, it feels lightweight and, crucially, non-greasy.</p><p>This moisturiser only uses natural ingredients so you know your skin isn't being subjected to harsh chemicals - a real bonus for sensitive skin.</p><p>Don't expect a strong scent from this one because that's not where this product's strengths lie, but do expect to only need a small amount. A little goes a very long way, which is great because this is priced on the higher end of mid-range at £28.50 for 50ml, or if you want to size up, £49.50 for 125ml.</p><p>For a more in-depth review, read all about what we thought of the product in our <a href=# rel=noopener>Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream review.</a></p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><h2><strong>NIVEA Q10 Energy Healthy Glow Face Day Cream</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/61R1cAlDboL._AC_SL1180_.jpg><ul><li><strong>NIVEA Q10 Energy Healthy Glow Face Day Cream, £6.25 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Offering you a fresh face for less than £7, Nivea's Q10 Energy Healthy Glow Face Day Cream is an absolute steal.</p><p>The mix of vitamin C and E aims to rejuvenate tired-looking skin, whilst the SPF 15 looks after any sun damage too. What more could you want from a day cream?</p><p>Scent always has a big impact on our first impressions, and Nivea's cream simply smells of summer, creating a wonderful fusion of citrus and sun cream.</p><p>Applying this straight after cleansing leaves you feeling refreshed as it's a deeply hydrating cream that's quite thick – a small amount goes a long way.</p><p>We love that it has SPF 15 as even on cloudy days in winter, SPF can help fight the impacts of anti-ageing.</p><p>In terms of brightening, it was a refreshing cream that left our skin feeling soft and revitalised. So yes, it works. Our only advice is that this might not be best for particularly oily skin.</p><h2><strong>Naturium Multi-Peptide Face Cream</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UK200036501_NATURIUM.jpg><li><strong>Naturium Multi-Peptide Face Cream, £21 from SpaceNK - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li><p>Vegan and cruelty-free, the Naturium Multi-Peptide Moisturizer strives to improve your skin's elasticity, making it firmer.</p><p>In short, it's anti-ageing. It's suitable for any skin type, free from gluten, parabens and fragrances.</p><p>From the first use, we noticed how soft it feels on the skin and it settles into your face really quickly. It's basically not greasy at all, while still giving you great hydration.</p><p>We noticed how nicely it sits underneath makeup, keeping your face feeling moisturised all day long.</p><p>It's a little too early to notice the anti-ageing impacts, but we have faith in this bad boy.</p><h2>Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/PTRO0243F_1-e1659090800243.jpg><ul><li><strong>Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream, £45 from Beauty Bay - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>As a fan of Peter Thomas Roth's Hyaluronic Cloud mask, we were really excited to try out the cream that's in the same range.</p><p>At £45, it's a concentrated formula that apparently holds up to 1000 times its own weight in water, providing hydration for 72 hours.</p><p>First of all, it's really lightweight, taking the form of a soft wet layer of moisture over your skin.</p><p>We think this is one for those with more oily or combination skin, as we needed something heavier for our dry complexion.</p><p>However, when used in tandem with the eye patches and cream from the Cloud range, it's amazing.</p><p>Got the cash to splash?

Egyptian Magic Cream. Suffering from scarring? Egyptian Magic Cream. Dry skin? Egyptian Magic Cream. You get the point.</p><p>When applied, it feels like a film over the skin, locking in hydration while also acting as a barrier against external aggressors like pollution and the weather.</p><p>It doesn't smell of anything at all, but a little goes a very long way and once it's on, that film-like consistency leaves skin glowing immediately.</p><p>It's not vegan, but it is cruelty-free and really does leave skin feeling intensely hydrated and soothed, making it perfect for all skin types.</p><p>Read our full <a href=# rel=noopener>review of Egyptian Magic Cream here</a>.</p><h2>Olay Regenerist Ultra Rich Day Face Cream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10289280.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Olay Regenerist Ultra Rich Day Face Cream, £13.18 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Featuring in Olay's Regenerist range, the Ultra Rich Day Face Cream claims to intensely hydrate your skin for 24 hours while firming and reinvigorating your complexion.</p><p>The formula is a combination of vitamin B3 (Niacinamide), peptides and shea butter, made to be used as a day cream prior to applying makeup.</p><p>We found the cream's texture instantly surprising as it's butter-like, with a thickness that means you apply it as you would Vaseline.</p><p>With a slightly fragranced smell, this moisturiser feels like the perfect base for make-up – one dab on each cheek and our forehead was enough to give deep hydration with a smoothing finish.</p><p>As our skin is typically dry, we fell in love with the thickness of this Olay cream as it feels as though it gives you a deep moisturise without being greasy at all.</p><p>This is a must-have for our fellow dry and sensitive skin sufferers out there, we'll be getting more when it runs out — that's for sure.</p><h2><strong>L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Filler [+ Hyaluronic Acid] Eye Cream</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12765070-1784830288074514.jpg><ul><li><strong>L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Filler [+ Hyaluronic Acid] Eye Cream For Face 30ml, £13.39 from LookFantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>L'Oréal Paris has created a formula that apparently reduces the fine lines on your face, plumping and hydrating your skin for a youthful look.</p><p>Blended with Hyaluronic Acid, the Revitalift Filler Eye Cream for Face can be applied all the way down to your neck, and apparently, in a matter of weeks, you can already see the lifting effects.</p><p>We sampled it to see if it was worth almost 20 quid.</p><p>One pump is enough to cover your face, so although the tube is only 30ml, we can see it lasting a while (well, long enough to see if there are actually any results).</p><p>The cream feels fresh as there's no fragrance and it's not too thick, moisturising our dry skin perfectly without leaving it greasy at all.</p><p>Within a week of use, our skin definitely felt more hydrated and even firmer, having used it religiously both day and night.</p><p>The results were so minor that we're not sure if we were imagining them, but apparently, the best results arrive in around eight weeks when your undereye, forehead, crow's feet, glabellar and nasolabial are all smoothed out. Let's hope we have that to look forward to.</p><h2><strong>CeraVe Facial Moisturising Lotion No SPF 52ml</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11798688-1194696099173549.jpg><ul><li><strong>CeraVe Facial Moisturising Lotion No SPF 52ml, £15 from LookFantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Skincare brand CeraVe develops all of its products with dermatologists – the Facial Moisturising Lotion is a no-nonsense, natural cream acting as a glass of water for your skin.</p><p>At £13, this cream, comprising of naturally-occurring ceramides and Hyaluronic Acid, says it will offer 24-hour hydration for your face, soothing sensitivity and leaving your complexion feeling calm.</p><p>We received the 52ml tube in the post and were surprised at how small and compact it is, with the pump only letting out a little squirt each time.</p><p>You only really need a small amount though, as the ultra-light, wet formula spreads easily around your skin, suggesting this small bottle will last a while as part of your daily routine.</p><p>CeraVe's Facial Moisturising Lotion has no scent and felt gentle on our sensitive skin, but it definitely feels more like a light hydrating cream than one that would leave our skin deeply moisturised.</p><p>It's perfect for wearing with primer and make-up though, as it's not greasy and absorbs quickly. This one's probably our recommendation for daily use if your skin is sensitive to other creams.</p><h2><strong>Curél Intensive Moisture Facial Cream for Dry Sensitive Skin</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cur_eacute_l_intensive_moisture_facial_cream_for_dry_sensitive_skin_40g_1632132869-e1638534538996.jpg><ul><li><strong>Curél Intensive Moisture Facial Cream for Dry Sensitive Skin, £14.60 from FeelUnique - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Sensitive and dry skin sisters listen up. The Curél Intensive moisturiser is made for you.</p><p>A best-seller over in Japan, this lightweight cream stops your face from drying out without harming it with alcohol or fragrances.</p><p>We love how light this feels as you apply it, unlike a lot of heavy-duty creams which are made for people who suffer from dry skin.</p><p>From the first time we used it, this moisturiser made our face feel refreshed and softer for longer.</p><p>It feels really natural and gentle which is always a benefit for products that you use every day. We're honestly surprised that it's less than £20 — it's an absolute bargain because a tiny pea-sized amount is enough to see results.</p><h2>Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/frefre005_fresh_rosedeephydration_15ml_2_1560x1960-0jsd5jpg-e1615567474151.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream, £13 from Cult Beauty - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Fresh is known for incorporating unique, natural ingredients into its products, from soy and sake to sugar, and its Rose Deep Hydration Face Cream has become a cult favourite.</p><p>For just £13 you get 15ml of Fresh's blend of&nbsp;rose water, rose flower oil, angelica leaf extract and vitamin E, promising to nourish and moisturise your face.</p><p>We tested out the 50ml tub, which comes in a sturdy rose-tinted glass pot, doubling as a decoration in the bathroom.</p><p>Our opinion upon first opening? It smells like a fresh rose garden, giving you a wonderful start to the day or calming scent to wind down in the evening.</p><p>It's not thick at all but a small amount goes a long way and leaves your skin feeling gently refreshed and reinvigorated. We recommend massaging it into your neck after your face for a rose scent that'll follow you throughout the day.</p><h2><strong>Sand&Sky Tasmanian Water Hydration Boost Cream</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/13312983-8824896606235587-e1638534925164.jpg><ul><li><strong>Sand&Sky Tasmanian Water Hydration Boost Cream, £44.99 from Asos - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The Sand&Sky clay mask might have gone viral, but it's time people got to know the brand's Tasmanian Water Hydration Boost Cream.</p><p>Apparently, Tasmanian water is one of the most mineral-rich in the world. In a gel texture, this moisturiser is equipped with Hyaluronic Acid, red algae and Tasmanian water which holds essential minerals, calcium and magnesium.</p><p>Unlike most creams, this one is more like a wet jelly. It glides onto your face with a cooling effect, making you feel really refreshed as you start or end the day.</p><p>Is it worth £44.90? Well, a combination of Hyaluronic Acid and a good, basic moisturiser would probably do a similar thing. We prefer this, though.</p><p>We would recommend forking out for it if you have particularly dry skin because it's so hydrating. However, if your skin is oily then you might prefer to spend your money on firming serums and face masks.</p><h2><strong>Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Moisturiser 88ml</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10276939.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Moisturiser 88ml, £14.50 from Boots - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Cetaphil is a dermatologist-recommended skincare brand known for gentle, fragrance-free moisturisers and cleansers.</p><p>Boasting that it's light and quick-absorbing, the Daily Hydrating Moisturiser sounds like a staple for everyone's day and night routines at under £13.</p><p>Our review? First things first, the cream is extremely lightweight, with an almost gel-like consistency that makes it really gentle to wear. You can definitely sense the Hyaluronic Acid on your skin.</p><p>Compared to others, it feels as though it simply complements your complexion rather than intensely hydrating or firming it, making it ideal for people with sensitive skin.</p><p>Although our skin is sensitive, it is also ridiculously dry, especially, when we tried this out, when the weather was freezing in London.</p><p>It's too lightweight for a deep moisturise, although it does wear well underneath makeup so we think it's probably best for those with oily skin looking for something to complement the serums they already use.</p><h2><strong>La Roche-Posay Toleriane Sensitive Rich Moisturiser</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11855112-4424651986582309.jpg><ul><li><strong>La Roche-Posay Toleriane Sensitive Rich Moisturiser, £17.50 from Boots - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>With La Roche-Posay's Toleriane Sensitive Rich moisturiser, it's all in the name.</p><p>Combining glycerin, shea butter, vitamin B3 and La Roche-Posay Thermal Water, this is a face cream made for sensitive skin types that need an extra rich moisturise or just a little TLC.</p><p>When we received the 40ml tube, we were thinking that it won't even last the month but once you squirt a bit out, you realise it's a really thick formula which means you only want a small amount to avoid greasy-ness.</p><p>It. Smells. Amazing. The hints of shea butter sure seep through, with this face cream giving you a full coverage moisturise, one that is a little too much for someone with oily skin.</p><p>Luckily (kind of), our skin is dry so this worked wonders to deeply hydrate our face for a full day and we even woke up the next day with a smoother complexion.</p><p>At under £17, if you struggle with dry skin then this has got to be on your radar.</p><h2>Florena Fermented Skincare 24H Hydrating Day Cream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/10293219.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Florena Fermented Skincare 24H Hydrating Day Cream, £9.99 from Boots - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The Florena Fermented Skincare 24H Hydrating Day Cream does what it says on the tin, leaving your skin moisturised all day long.</p><p>Blending fermented olive oil, coconut oil and avocado oil, this is a vegan day cream that is also packaged from recycled plastic – we love any step towards greener living.</p><p>We'd never been introduced to Florena prior to trying out this cream, and the 50ml tub felt quite small but as it's quite a wet texture, a small amount gets you quite far.</p><p>The rose petal print on the box hints to the scent that lays inside, it smells floral but natural all at once, and gives you a firm, hydrated complexion.</p><p>Perhaps due to the olive oil, it's very slightly greasy, ensuring that your skin stays well moisturised throughout the day.</p><p>As we suffer with dry skin, we found this as a perfect light cream to apply with hyaluronic acid serum. Plus, the packaging is really lightweight, ideal for taking with you everywhere you go.</p><h2>Harborist Environmental Moisture Light</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EML_on_grey_v02_v07_900x-e1642503008202.jpg><ul><li><strong>Environmental Moisture Light, £39 from Harborist - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>One of the more expensive finds on our list, Harborist's Environmental Moisture Light had a lot to live up to, priced at £45 for 50ml.</p><p>Perfect for normal to combination skin, this vegan face cream combines lots of natural ingredients like raspberry, aloe, leaf extract, radish root ferment and coconut.</p><p>For that reason, we were expecting it to smell fruity but it's unscented, smelling more like e45 cream than other fragranced moisturisers.</p><p>Using a pea-sized amount as recommended, we massaged it into our face and our sensitive, dry skin felt immediately nourished.</p><p>It might be a small bottle, but the lightweight texture sure packs a hydrating punch that soaks right into your pores, creating an amazing base for primer and foundation.</p><p>Compared to other fancier-looking or smelling formulas on the market, this feels like a no-nonsense gift to your skin.</p><h2>Can you use E45 cream on your face?</h2><p>You can use E45 cream on your face and body although there are lots of products out there that are formulated specifically for your face which might be more appropriate.</p><p>Listen to your skin and use whatever works for you.</p><h2>Can you use hand cream on your face?</h2><p>With so many sophisticated face creams available, we would recommend against using hand cream on your face.</p><p>Because it's so thick, it can clog up pores and lead to breakouts which is not the outcome any of us want.</p><h2>How to make face creams</h2><p>There are lots of tutorials and recipes for making face creams at home, but our advice is to stick with the professionals.</p><p>There are face creams at a whole range of price points that have been researched and tested so you know that what you are putting on your skin is safe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpsY2d9eXyRaJmeq6Ris6KvxGaaq52RosBw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-face-creams.html&text=Best%20Face%20Cream%20For%20Women%202023&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-face-creams.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-face-creams.html&title=Best%20Face%20Cream%20For%20Women%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-face-creams.html&title=Best%20Face%20Cream%20For%20Women%202023" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-face-creams.html&title=Best%20Face%20Cream%20For%20Women%202023" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-face-creams.html&description=Best%20Face%20Cream%20For%20Women%202023" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./frank-bough-dead-age-87-scandal-marred-glittering-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Frank Bough won the heart of the nation before one &amp;quot;moment of stupidity&amp;quot; marred a glittering car">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./3khhna9itidtzeigejudbq1nv79o8wxe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch The Casagrandes Season 2 Episode 20: Lalo Land/Maybe-Sitter">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
