Choi Sung-bong was a well-known South Korean singer who lived from 1990 until 2023. Choi Sung-bong, 33, tragically committed suicide in June 2023.</p><p>Bong rose to notoriety in 2011 after performing an outstanding performance of Ennio Morricone’s “Nella Fantasia” on the reality TV program “Korea’s Got Talent.” This performance was a launching pad for his career. His skill carried him to the competition’s finals, where he eventually finished as first runner-up.&nbsp;Choi Sung-bong garnered praise from various performers after posting his performance on YouTube, including Justin Bieber, BoA, and Jung Hwa-um. According to reports, the worldwide press dubbed him “the next Susan Boyle” after viewing his performance with English subtitles.</p><p>As Choi Sung-bong’s reputation grew on ‘Korea’s Got Talent,’ other entertainment groups contacted him with contract offers. He eventually secured a deal with Sony Music Korea Inc., but in December 2011, he decided to cancel the arrangement. He was managed by Bongbong Company till his tragic death in 2023.</p><h2>Was Choi Sung Bong a Gay or He Was Dating Anyone?</h2><p><strong>Choi Sung Bong’s</strong> sexual orientation has been described as gay throughout his career, rather than homosexual. Nonetheless, he was not rumored to be married and was most likely unmarried. Choi never mentioned his wife in any interview or on any of his social media accounts. He had a difficult upbringing. He was abandoned at the age of three and put in a Seoul orphanage, where he suffered physical abuse. Seeking sanctuary from the maltreatment, he escaped the orphanage at the age of five and found refuge in Daejeon’s red-light districts.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Choi-Sung-Bong-1.jpg alt="Choi Sung Bong" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In an interview, he said that when he was 14, he sought sanctuary in a night school to avoid gang members in the region.&nbsp;Choi Sung-bong went to Dae-Jeon Art High School in Daejeon, South Korea, and worked as a delivery driver to help pay for his school tuition and private classes.&nbsp;During his school years, he discovered a love for singing and sought instruction from Jeong-So Park, a mentor who trained him for free.&nbsp;Despite the fact that Choi had the chance to study at Hanyang University, financial restrictions prohibited him from completing his undergraduate degree.&nbsp;For a decade, the late singer sold gum and energy drinks at nightclubs to make ends meet.</p><h2>Who was Choi Sung Bong’s partner At the time of his death?</h2><p>As previously said, Choi Sung Bong was never seen with a love partner throughout his career. Almost all major media outlets claimed him to be unmarried.&nbsp;The South Korean music singer, who was praised by Justin Bieber, unfortunately committed himself at the age of 33.&nbsp;According to The Korea Times, officials spotted him at his home in Seoul’s Yeoksam-dong district around 9:41 a.m. on Tuesday. This comes two years after he was chastised for fraudulently pretending to have cancer and asking followers for money.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Choi-Sung-Bong-2.jpg alt="Choi Sung Bong" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Choi Sung-bong, according to Variety, released a video on YouTube with a message on Monday, June 19, just one day before his death.&nbsp;He conveyed his thanks and gratitude in the video to the numerous individuals who had shown him attention and affection from 2011 to the present. He said that he had tried for a decade to live a regular life, but eventually expressed his regret for doing wrong.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoaeZYsC2usZmmaiml2K0qr7Ln6minZ6Zerit0mafnmWXlsZuu9Fmm5qsmaO0bq3NsqannV2stqy1jJqlnWWWlrqquNho</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchoi-sung-bong-girlfriend-was-he-gay-or-dating-anyone-wiki-and-family.html&text=Choi%20Sung%20Bong%20Girlfriend%3a%20Was%20He%20Gay%20or%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Wiki%20And%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchoi-sung-bong-girlfriend-was-he-gay-or-dating-anyone-wiki-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchoi-sung-bong-girlfriend-was-he-gay-or-dating-anyone-wiki-and-family.html&title=Choi%20Sung%20Bong%20Girlfriend%3a%20Was%20He%20Gay%20or%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Wiki%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchoi-sung-bong-girlfriend-was-he-gay-or-dating-anyone-wiki-and-family.html&title=Choi%20Sung%20Bong%20Girlfriend%3a%20Was%20He%20Gay%20or%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Wiki%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchoi-sung-bong-girlfriend-was-he-gay-or-dating-anyone-wiki-and-family.html&title=Choi%20Sung%20Bong%20Girlfriend%3a%20Was%20He%20Gay%20or%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Wiki%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchoi-sung-bong-girlfriend-was-he-gay-or-dating-anyone-wiki-and-family.html&description=Choi%20Sung%20Bong%20Girlfriend%3a%20Was%20He%20Gay%20or%20Dating%20Anyone%3f%20Wiki%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tom-sandoval-ariana-madix-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos of the Ex-Couple  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./all-under-one-banner-thousands-of-scottish-independence-supporters-march-through-edinburgh.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All Under One Banner: Thousands of Scottish independence supporters march through Edinburgh  The ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
