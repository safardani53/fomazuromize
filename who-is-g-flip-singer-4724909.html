So it’s nice,” she added. Since their ceremony, the reality star also revealed that she and her boo have matching tattoos.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“We randomly met at a Halloween party and we were both dressed as skeletons and then months later, by the time, you know, there was a long courting process and all this stuff where I had to, like I said, deconstruct everything,” Chrishell said on SiriusXM on Saturday, May 27 — revealing they both got matching skeletons. “I’m not, you know, growing up with Disney, I’m not exactly what you would’ve imagined, but maybe we’re just two skeletons, like the day we met,” she also said. G Flip added, “Just because at the end of the day, who cares about anything? We are just skeletons. It’s so meaningful.” During the same interview, the duo also denied that they wed due to Aussie born G Flip requiring a visa or green card to live in the US. “She already has a passport,” Chrishell said. “Well, everyone is like ‘gotcha’ [on the legality of our wedding],” she went on, doubling down on the fact that they did indeed “get married” but doesn’t feel they have to “prove” or “get approval” from anyone.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Selling Sunset</a> star was first spotted kissing G Flip in Los Angeles on May 5, 2022. The pair looked quite cozy as they packed on the PDA while hanging out at the famed West Hollywood bar The Abbey. Dressed in a revealing mesh top with a black bra underneath, Chrishell, who<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> called it quits with <strong>Jason Oppenheim</strong> </a>in 2021, looked to be enjoying her steamy make out session with the Australian musician, who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Find out more about G-Flip below!</p><h2>G Flip has been involved in music since they were nine.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/G-Flip-singer-hold-hands-Chrishell-Stause-ss-post1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The talented star, whose birth name is Georgia Claire Flipo, started playing drums when they were nine in Australia. They became a session drummer for various music acts, including the Melbourne band <strong>Empra</strong>, as well as a backup singer before they eventually wrote and recorded their own songs. They debuted their first single, “About You” in early 2018 and it Pitchfork named it “Best New Track” that same year. The music video was filmed on their iPhone and was featured on YouTube’s New Music Playlist.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Their follow up single, “Killing My Time,” was released in May 2018 after they played their first solo show at SXSW in Austin, TX.</p><h2>Their debut album was released in 2019.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>About Us was released in August 2019. It was promoted through an Australian tour and was nominated for several awards, including an ARIA Music Award and a J Award. The album received several great reviews, including one from AllMusic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“Flipo finds ways to give&nbsp;<i>About Us</i>&nbsp;more personality whenever [their] tales of lust and heartache could become generic… [and] by the time the album closes with the happily ever after of ‘2 Million’, Flipo proves that in love and in [their] music, [they’re] never less than fully committed — and that’s what makes&nbsp;<i>About Us</i> a promising debut,” the review read.</p><h2>They seemed to hint at their relationship with Chrishell in a tweet.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>The tweet, which was posted on May 1, 2022, was in response to a fan that claimed Chrishell was “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>too pretty</a> to be with a man.” The singer made it known they are in agreement with the fan with a simple yet powerful word. “Agreed,” their response read.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Agreed</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>— G FLIP (@gflipmusic) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 1, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Chrishell also referred to G Flip as her “date” in an Instagram story around the same time.</p><h2>They’re a football fan<strong>.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>G Flip has reportedly been an avid supporter of the Collingwood Football Club, which is based in Melbourne. They have also advocated for AFL Women, which is Australia’s national semiprofessional&nbsp;Australian rules football&nbsp;league for&nbsp;female players. They once performed at the 2021 NAB AFLW Grand Final.</p><h2>They are passionate about suicide awareness.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>G Flip shared an Instagram post about suicide awareness and it included a photo of them wearing a shirt that had “#ENDYOUTHSUICIDE” on the front of it as well as a caption that expressed the importance of suicide prevention.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“Listen up crew, suicide is the biggest killer of young Australians aged between 15 and 24. The best intervention when you find yourself feeling low and vulnerable is a support network so PLEASE check in with yourself, your peers, your mates and your family ❤️❤️❤️❤️ be a f*cking legend and CHECK IN ON PEOPLE ! Ask people how they really are ✨,” part of the caption read.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K0brLLoqdmq5mjtKa%2BjG1ua2xpZYZw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-g-flip-singer-4724909.html&text=Who%20Is%20G%20Flip%3f%20Five%20Facts%20About%20Singer%20Married%20To%20Chrishell%20Stause%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-g-flip-singer-4724909.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-g-flip-singer-4724909.html&title=Who%20Is%20G%20Flip%3f%20Five%20Facts%20About%20Singer%20Married%20To%20Chrishell%20Stause%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-g-flip-singer-4724909.html&title=Who%20Is%20G%20Flip%3f%20Five%20Facts%20About%20Singer%20Married%20To%20Chrishell%20Stause%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-g-flip-singer-4724909.html&title=Who%20Is%20G%20Flip%3f%20Five%20Facts%20About%20Singer%20Married%20To%20Chrishell%20Stause%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-g-flip-singer-4724909.html&description=Who%20Is%20G%20Flip%3f%20Five%20Facts%20About%20Singer%20Married%20To%20Chrishell%20Stause%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-rick-savage-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Rick Savage Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gallery-sitemap.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mandy Moore">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
