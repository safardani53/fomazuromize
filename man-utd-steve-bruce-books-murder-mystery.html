It didn't make any contribution at all to anyone's income.</p><p>"It became a laughing stock, to be honest. I think they're probably still on the shelves somewhere, and I bet you could probably pick one up for 99p."</p><p>Indeed, when asked why he hasn't written any more books in a 2019 interview with <a aria-label="Sky Sports (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sky Sports</a>, Bruce replied: "Have you read them? Go and read them and you'll understand why."</p><p>Regardless, they have grown into cult classics, with a used paperback copy of his first book Striker! fetching as much as £249 on <a href=#>Amazon</a>.</p><p>And that is some increase from the £12 the book was originally sold for.</p><p>The books themselves are written in the first person from the point of view of protagonist Steve Barnes.</p><p>O'Reilly loved his dive into the 127-page story told in Striker!, detailing the "mad stuff" that goes on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/books-written-steve-bruce-466702624.jpg><p>Striker! opens with Pat Duffy, the young Irish striker of Leddersford Town FC - a small but historic club aiming for promotion to the top flight - having been found stabbed to death in the dressing room.</p><p>Barnes, who is the manager of Town, is naturally among the suspects and launches his own investigation to get to the bottom of the mystery, all the while juggling his management of the team.</p><p>"The book is filled with kidnappings, betrayal and suspense," O'Reilly explains.</p><p>The front cover of the book depicts the aftermath of the crime, with a player in a blue and white striped shirt lying on the floor next to the murder weapon.</p><p>Although Duffy does appear to be a giant based on his blown-up proportions while lying on a football pitch.</p><p>Barnes faces off with Irish mobsters and even finds himself in the sights of a sniper during a match.</p><h2>'Kidnappings, betrayal and suspense'</h2><p>In the final four pages, Barnes has a ball shot from underneath his foot while standing in the technical area in a top-of-the-table clash with <a href=#>Fulham</a>.</p><p>There is also a running gag throughout the book where Bruce writes in detail about the car Barnes is driving, even in the middle of an espionage mission.</p><p>At one point he writes: "I drive a <a href=#>Jaguar</a> XJ8, 3.2, the sports version. It’s a very nice motor; 3.2 litre AJ-V8 all alloy engine.</p><p>"Classic colour interior theme, fluted leather seats, contrast colour keyed facia, figured walnut veneer. As good a motor as you can hope to drive.</p><p>"But not a car you’d choose when trying to follow a <a href=#>Ford</a> saloon in a discreet manner…my registration, license and all other statutory details are fully up to date."</p><p>The second book, Sweeper!, does not tone down on the drama levels either, with the plot centring around the kidnapping of the club's janitor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/books-written-steve-bruce-466702621.jpg><p>O'Reilly goes so far as to declare Sweeper! the "magnum opus" of Bruce's written work in the so-called "Bruniverse".</p><p>The plot of Sweeper! sees Barnes take on Yugoslavian warlords, lesbian prostitutes, Nazi-hunting spies and more.</p><p>A particular highlight of O'Reilly's is when Bruce makes a reference to his lack of international recognition - having never received an <a href=#>England</a> cap - in one of the four kidnappings throughout the series.</p><p>After Barnes is kidnapped by British Secret Service agents, who then ask him to go undercover, O'Reilly explains that Barnes refuses to help, saying: "He tells them, 'My country never wanted me'."</p><p>"His reasoning for not helping counter-terrorism is not that he lacks training or expertise or that he's a middle-aged <a href=#>football manager</a>, it's that he never got an international cap."</p><p>One book in the series even sees Barnes take out a bad guy with a slide tackle.</p><h2>'Magnum opus of the Bruniverse'</h2><p>But that isn't to say the books don't have criticism from the Derry-born Bruce superfan.</p><p>He explained: "There are so many strange decisions made in the writing of these books, such as the way the world is constructed.</p><p>"So, for instance, there's fake names that stand in for real places, like Leddersford for Huddersfield and Mulcaster for Manchester.</p><p>"But, he also talks about Manchester United and mentions Alex Ferguson. It's like reading a <a href=#>Batman</a> comic where he takes a train from Gotham to New York."</p><p>The third book is described as "incident-free" and "disappointing" by O'Reilly.</p><p>And one brutal comment on the Amazon review section for the book seems to agree, saying: "Does for the English language what the Luftwaffe did to Coventry."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">READ MORE SPORT FEATURES</h2></p><p>Amazon reviews for the earlier books are far more positive.</p><p>One user commented on Striker!: "Ahead of its time, ahead of anyone’s time. So bad it’s great."</p><p>A second remarked: "There is something about this book that makes it absolutely brilliant... even though it's, err, awful!</p><p>"Hours that I will never have again, but I'm glad that I spent them reading this."</p><p>One, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, review of Sweeper! says: "One cannot do justice to how effective and gripping Bruce's writing style is. He is truly a modern-day Arthur Conan Doyle."</p><p>While it seems likely that Bruce will not be adding to his library with any new works, O'Reilly believes he has read through the reviews.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He added: "I do certainly like to think Steve Bruce has read the reviews.</p><p>"There's just this image in my head of Bruce at home, rushing in from training, tapping away incessantly on his Remington in an oak-panelled study."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/books-written-steve-bruce-466702619.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH90hZVya29tX6Kur3nUrZtmq6Saw6Z5wausnJ1dl7ywt9JmpK6qlJq%2FbrnYrKueqqlk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fman-utd-steve-bruce-books-murder-mystery.html&text=Man%20Utd%20legend%20wrote%20three%20murder%20mysteries%20that%20have%20become%20cult%20classics%2c%20but%20he%20says%20they%27re%20a%20%27l&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fman-utd-steve-bruce-books-murder-mystery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fman-utd-steve-bruce-books-murder-mystery.html&title=Man%20Utd%20legend%20wrote%20three%20murder%20mysteries%20that%20have%20become%20cult%20classics%2c%20but%20he%20says%20they%27re%20a%20%27l" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fman-utd-steve-bruce-books-murder-mystery.html&title=Man%20Utd%20legend%20wrote%20three%20murder%20mysteries%20that%20have%20become%20cult%20classics%2c%20but%20he%20says%20they%27re%20a%20%27l" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fman-utd-steve-bruce-books-murder-mystery.html&title=Man%20Utd%20legend%20wrote%20three%20murder%20mysteries%20that%20have%20become%20cult%20classics%2c%20but%20he%20says%20they%27re%20a%20%27l" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fman-utd-steve-bruce-books-murder-mystery.html&description=Man%20Utd%20legend%20wrote%20three%20murder%20mysteries%20that%20have%20become%20cult%20classics%2c%20but%20he%20says%20they%27re%20a%20%27l" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michael-dameski-19951107-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Dameski (Dancer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./khloe-kardashian-pregnant-fertility-treatments-infertility-problems.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Khloe Kardashians Pregnant Future  Fertility Treatments Can Help  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
