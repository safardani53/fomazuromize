His mother, Tammy Hill, was still a teenager when she had first met his dad, Andre Dawkins Sr.</p><p>Before him, Tammy had given birth to his older sister, Lacey Dawkins. However, she died in a car accident in 2009.</p><p>Andre’s parents married a year after he was born, moving back to his childhood. The family lived together in Virginia, where his father worked as a financial advisor in a firm.</p><p>But, his parents separated when he was just five. His father won custody of him two years later, and he began living in Virginia with his dad and stepmother. His biological mother and Lacey lived apart in Ohio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Dawkins-with-his-late-sister-Lacey.jpg><p>His dad and stepmother, Pamela, had three more kids. The athlete had a very good relationship with his stepmother, whom he called Miss Pam as she used to work in a local school.</p><p>Likewise, he had a good bonding with his half-siblings.</p><p>Dawkins initially attended the Deep Creek High School in Chesapeake, Virginia, for his schooling. He was very good at his studies since he was a kid and always got good grades.</p><p>Apart from that, he was athletic and good at sports. He began playing basketball at Deep Creek and was a fast learner. He already had good knowledge of basic basketball skills before he shifted to another high school in the same town.</p><p>His family supported him but always advised him to continue his academic life too. Moreover, his biological mother and sister, Lacey, often visited and motivated him.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, he graduated from Atlantic Shores Christian Academy with good numbers in 2009 and enrolled in Duke University in North Carolina for his further studies.</p><h2>Andre Dawkins | Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Dawkins was not so tall as a high schooler, so he mostly preferred to play as a shooting guard.</p><p>Even though it was a bit disadvantageous due to his shorter height, he mostly showed good performance.</p><p>For his outstanding game throughout his sophomore year, he was named the conference player of the year. He had 22.4 points and 7.0 rebounds per game that season.</p><p>Furthermore, he continued playing better and won several honors during his high school years. While still in high school, he opted to go to Duke University for his college career.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt; Kostas Antetokounmpo: Career, Family & Net Worth >>></strong></a></p><h3>College Career</h3><p>Even though Dawkins joined Duke a year ahead with great aspirations, his dream was immediately shattered. His sister, Lacey Dawkins, died in a car accident just after he had begun his first college season.</p><p>Lacey and Tammy, their mother, were going to Durham from Ohio to watch his game while the incident happened. However, his mother was injured and later recovered.</p><p>But, it affected him deeply, and he could not focus well even though he played maximum matches. As a result, he could only average 4.4 points per game in his rookie season.</p><p>He was part of the Blue Devils as a backup guard, so he became the national champion that year.</p><p>Dawkins played the remaining three seasons of his college but with minimal improvement.&nbsp;</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Andre decided to go for the NBA draft in 2014 after having an average career with the Duke Blue Devils. However, no NBA clubs took an interest in him, so he remained undrafted.</p><p>However, he signed with the Miami Heat on September 23 to play the 2014 NBA Summer League for them. But, he appeared on the court rarely and was benched almost all the time.</p><p>In addition, the club allowed him to appear for a brief time in the regular season matches. After a short stint with the Sioux Falls Skyforce, he returned to the Heat and played four matches with almost no playtime.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Andre-Dawkins-in-the-Miami-Heat-jersey.jpg><p>The club eventually saw no benefit from him and waived him in early 2015. Since then, he never returned to the regular season NBA ever again.&nbsp;</p><p>Andre signed with the Boston Celtics for various short-duration contracts for a while and was mostly assigned to their D-League affiliate club, Maine Red Claws (now Maine Celtics).</p><p>Furthermore, he even traveled abroad to try his luck in the Italian basketball league, the LBA, in 2015. But, he soon returned home and played in the NBA G League for some years.</p><p>After associating with various NBA G League clubs such as Texas Legends, Windy City Bulls, etc., he continued his professional league journey with much difficulty until 2017.</p><p>He eventually announced his retirement from his professional career in 2018. He was with the Agua Caliente Clippers during his retirement.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><ul><li>NCAA champion (2010)</li><li>NBA D-League All-Rookie Third Team (2015)</li></ul><h2>Andre Dawkins | Net Worth, Salary & Career Earnings&nbsp;</h2><p>The exact net worth of the former NBA player is unknown.
