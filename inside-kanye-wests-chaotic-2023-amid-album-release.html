There's more to come, despite the haters."</p><p>Here, The U.S. Sun takes a look back at yet another wild year for the artist now known as Ye as he drops his <a href=#>new album Vultures</a> and shows no signs of stopping his bizarre antics.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>NEW WIFE</h2><p>Kanye, 46, secretly tied the knot with his Yeezy architect Bianca Censori, an Australian native, on December 20 last year after finalizing his divorce from <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>.</p><p>But news of their official nuptials didn't break until October when it was reported they used a "confidential marriage license," per documents&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">obtained by the Daily Mail</a>.</p><p>They said "I do" at a secret venue in Palo Alto, <a href=#>California</a>, and have had a whirlwind year, despite Kanye being blacklisted by many for his outrageous comments.</p><p>The couple spent the beginning of 2023 renting a 1,820-square-foot one-bed, one-and-a-half bath apartment in West Hollywood with the rent estimated at $6,650 a month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/kanye-west-wife-bianca-censori-836697186-5.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/kanye-west-wife-bianca-censori-865769523.jpg><p>Barely a week went by without a new set of photographs showing Bianca in boob-baring outfits as Kanye grabbed ice cream in the neighborhood.</p><p>They also raised eyebrows at Sunday Service in June, with <a href=#>Bianca constrained</a> in a black&nbsp;gauze-like dress&nbsp;covering her from head to toe, while Kanye opted for shoulder pads and sock shoes.</p><p>Followers were quick to react to how Kanye was reportedly dressing her after being strict about his ex's fashion choices.</p><p>One said on&nbsp;<a href=#>Reddit</a>: "What on earth is happening here?" while another added: "Oh this is just so scary!"</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>BUYING HQ</h2><p>Earlier in the year, Kanye also <a href=#>secretly purchased</a> a 7,416-square-foot commercial building on Melrose Avenue for $6.7 million which was set to be a "multi-purpose <a href=#>Yeezy HQ</a>."</p><p>The deal was done through Oxpaha LLC, according to property records seen by The U.S. Sun.</p><p>Kanye&nbsp;set up a similar company - Ox Paha Inc - in October when he trademarked the word "yews" under some classifications from cosmetics to clothing.</p><p>He hired disgraced Jewish&nbsp;American&nbsp;Apparel&nbsp;founder&nbsp;<a href=#>Dov Charney</a> as the new&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;of&nbsp;Yeezy to revamp the brand after being dropped by numerous big names.</p><p>It was recently reported Adidas is considering writing off the remaining $320 million worth of Yeezy shoes left unsold for the third release since <a href=#>cutting ties with the star</a>.</p><p>They sold millions in the earlier releases with part of the profits being donated to groups fighting antisemitism.</p><p>But despite his efforts, <a href=#>Kanye's new HQ</a> has barely been used and the star is yet to fully relaunch Yeezy.</p><p>A source told The U.S. Sun he has been hiring mostly interns, with only a few staffers on sewing machines seen at the warehouse in West Hollywood.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>OUTRAGE IN ITALY</h2><p>At the beginning of summer, Kanye and Bianca switched gears and completely ditched West Hollywood to go globe-trotting, spending weeks in Italy.</p><p>But what began as a romantic, fun trip, as they were cheered by crowds in the streets, took an unexpected turn when they were photographed sharing an <a href=#>eye-raising intimate moment</a> while being chauffeured by boat in the city.</p><p>In snaps obtained by The U.S. Sun, Bianca could be seen crouched down at Kanye's lap, as the musician flashed his bare butt to cameras and passers-by.</p><p>The company responsible for the taxi boat, Venezia Turismo Motoscafi, later spoke out against the couple's alleged behavior.</p><p>They stated: "On board, the driver had to keep a lookout for traffic and did not see these obscenities."</p><p>They added: "We completely dissociate ourselves from such acts and behavior.</p><p>"Mr. West and his wife will certainly no longer be welcome on board our company's boats."</p><p>Despite the butt-baring incident, the pair continued to traipse around Italy without a care in the world as word got out that Kanye was recording a new album.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>THE MIDDLE EAST</h2><p>Bianca's family, however, were unimpressed with her trip to Italy, and she had "cut off" most of her friends, with sources telling the Daily Mail they were trying to stage an intervention.</p><p>Kanye has never commented on the claims, but the outlet alleged he has strict rules for his other half, including a fitness and diet regime, and telling her to remain mostly silent.</p><p>Within days of the leaked information making headlines, Bianca was seen back in <a href=#>Australia</a>, as a source told The U.S. Sun the pair were "taking a break."</p><p>But insiders later said despite the marriage taking its toll on her relationships with friends and family, Bianca was still fully committed to Kanye.</p><p>Days later, Kanye resurfaced in Saudi Arabia, recording at a makeshift studio at the five-star resort <a href=#>Banyan Tree</a>.</p><p>It offers one-bedroom villas for around $1,133 a night in the rocky canyons of&nbsp;Ashar Valley near the historic oasis city of AlUla, said to be "one of the world's most mysterious and exciting travel destinations."</p><p>As he took <a href=#>time away from Bianca</a>, his eldest daughter, 10-year-old North with ex Kim, was flown in to spend quality time with her dad.</p><p>Life for the star appeared to look more stable, as sources told The U.S. Sun he was set to reunite with Bianca and release a new track, Vultures, with collaborator Ty Dolla $ign.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>ANTI-SEMITIC LYRICS</h2><p>But it wasn't long before there was drama again, as he caused a ruckus at Atlantis The Royal Dubai resort, claiming he was being stalked by his former personal trainer Harley&nbsp;Pasternak.</p><p>While a report emerged showing Pasternak at the reception of the hotel, sources quickly slammed the claims he was doing anything untoward.</p><p>An insider confirmed to The U.S. Sun that the trainer often works with clients in the Middle East and felt threatened by Kanye after the run-in at the same hotel.</p><p>Other outlets also confirmed Pasternak phoned hotel security after Kanye began filming him.</p><p>After the drama subsided, Kanye continued to focus on partying in Dubai and dropped his new track, unsurprisingly featuring anti-Semitic lyrics.</p><p>In a clip, shared by the club Blu Dubai via an&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;story, Kanye can be heard rapping the lines: "How am I antisemitic? I just f**ked a Jewish b***h."</p><p>Chris Brown could be seen in several videos from the event laughing, dancing, and miming along to the line, after which he faced backlash on social media and denied being anti-Semitic.</p><p>After wrapping up in <a href=#>Dubai</a>, Kanye and Bianca took a private jet to Miami where the artist planned to make a big splash closing out Art Basel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'KKK HOOD' SHOCK</h2><p>He previewed tracks from his new album at several smaller events, including a brunch, as loyal fans were seen dancing and taking photographs of the star.</p><p>Kanye announced <a href=#>his record with Ty Dolla $ign</a> would drop on Friday, December 15, as he performed songs from his back catalog at DJ Khaled's birthday bash.</p><p>The night appeared to be a return of the old Kanye with the crowd lapping up hits.</p><p>But again, it was short-lived, as he was back to his usual controversial choices for his Vultures Rave in Miami to debut the full record.</p><p>Tickets were priced from $200 to tens of thousands for VIP access, but he didn't show up for hours after the party began.</p><p>He played music featuring the likes of <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href=#>Bad Bunny</a>, while his three children - North, 10, Saint, 8, and Chicago, 5.</p><p>Kanye's fourth child with his ex-wife, Psalm, 4, didn't appear to be at the event.</p><p>Later on in the evening, he took to the stage in a KKK-style black pointed hood with cut-out eyeholes, which left many on social media disgusted as his children were present.</p><p>At one point, North joined him onstage while he performed with the hood on.</p><p>One person blasted on social media: "That's not art, it's hate disguised as fashion."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The U.S. Sun's insider defended his decision, saying: "The hood was worn as a way to troll the KKK.</p><p>"He thinks wearing it will bring awareness of the oppression blacks suffered at the hands of the Klan."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/fans-question-kanye-wests-after-865830337.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/12/kanye-west-seen-leaving-e-859409803.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaGmEdIKSaKCnq5mZsm63wKewnmWnmsC1v4ycn5qnpJ6wbn6Pa2pmmZ2esW6ty5uspmWimrmmrdKeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-kanye-wests-chaotic-2023-amid-album-release.html&text=Inside%20Kanye%20West%27s%20chaotic%202023%20with%20shock%20marriage%20to%20Bianca%20Censori%2c%20Middle%20East%20move%2c%20and%20bizarr&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-kanye-wests-chaotic-2023-amid-album-release.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-kanye-wests-chaotic-2023-amid-album-release.html&title=Inside%20Kanye%20West%27s%20chaotic%202023%20with%20shock%20marriage%20to%20Bianca%20Censori%2c%20Middle%20East%20move%2c%20and%20bizarr" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-kanye-wests-chaotic-2023-amid-album-release.html&title=Inside%20Kanye%20West%27s%20chaotic%202023%20with%20shock%20marriage%20to%20Bianca%20Censori%2c%20Middle%20East%20move%2c%20and%20bizarr" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-kanye-wests-chaotic-2023-amid-album-release.html&title=Inside%20Kanye%20West%27s%20chaotic%202023%20with%20shock%20marriage%20to%20Bianca%20Censori%2c%20Middle%20East%20move%2c%20and%20bizarr" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-kanye-wests-chaotic-2023-amid-album-release.html&description=Inside%20Kanye%20West%27s%20chaotic%202023%20with%20shock%20marriage%20to%20Bianca%20Censori%2c%20Middle%20East%20move%2c%20and%20bizarr" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jim-white.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jim White">&larr;
