Notably, Jill is recognized as the Mercury Girl for Ford’s ads.</p><p>More so, in 2004, Maxim Magazine named Wagner in its Hot 100 Women’s list.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_to_Jill_Wagner></span><strong>What Happened to Jill Wagner?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In March 2008, it was announced Wagner would be the co-host for the ABC summer reality series Wipeout which premiered June 24, 2008.</p><p>In April 2011, Wagner announced that she was leaving Wipeout after four seasons to focus on her career.</p><p>She was succeeded by Vanessa Minnillo for the series’ fifth season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jill_Wager_Net_Worth></span><strong>Jill Wager Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wagner is a philanthropist.
